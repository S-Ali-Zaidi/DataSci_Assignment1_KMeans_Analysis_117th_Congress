Whereas the ongoing influx of migrants in Del Rio, Texas, 
poses a significant threat to the public health and safety 
of local communities; 
Whereas the migrant surge at the Del Rio International 
Bridge has evolved rapidly and unsustainably from 4,000 
migrants on September 15 to nearly 16,000 on Sep-
tember 18; 
Whereas Del Rio, Texas, a city of 35,000 residents, lacks the 
resources, infrastructure, and manpower to manage a mi-
grant population of this size and scope; 
Whereas the local health care infrastructure in Del Rio has 
been severely overwhelmed by the resulting uptick in pa-
tients; 
Whereas the above-mentioned events are occurring in tandem 
with the spread of COVID–19 variants across the United 
States; 
Whereas the spread of a communicable disease would be cata-
strophic for Val Verde County and the State of Texas at 
large; 
Whereas the sheer number of illegal border crossings has 
shifted the operational focus of border patrol agents from 
enforcement to processing, thereby creating national se-
curity vulnerabilities; 
Whereas these added processing duties have led to the closure 
of critical border checkpoints that serve as our second 
line of defense against illegal individuals and contraband; 
Whereas it is the Federal Government’s responsibility to pro-
tect our homeland from the consequences of illegal immi-
gration;

Whereas the Biden Administration’s rhetoric has enticed 
more than 1,300,000 migrants to illegally cross our 
southern border this year; 
Whereas the Biden Administration has pursued the cancella-
tion of previous immigration policies that were shown to 
be effective at stemming the tide of mass migration to 
the United States; and 
Whereas the Federal Government must fulfill its obligation to 
enforce our immigration laws: Now, therefore, be it
