SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The Confederate battle flag is one of the 
3
most controversial symbols from U.S. history, signi-
4
fying a representation of racism, slavery, and the op-
5
pression of African Americans. 
6
(2) The Confederate flag and the erection of 
7
Confederate monuments were used as symbols to re-
8
sist efforts to dismantle Jim Crow segregation, and 
9
have become pillars of Ku Klux Klan rallies. 
10
(3) There are at least 1,503 symbols of the 
11
Confederacy in public spaces, including 109 public 
12
schools named after prominent Confederates, many 
13
with large African-American student populations. 
14
(4) There are more than 700 Confederate 
15
monuments and statues on public property through-
16
out the country, the vast majority in the South. 
17
These include 96 monuments in Virginia, 90 in 
18
Georgia, and 90 in North Carolina.
