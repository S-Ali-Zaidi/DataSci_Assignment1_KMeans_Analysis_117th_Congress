Whereas the number of colorectal cancer cases among men is 
expected to be over 79,520 in 2021, and over 28,320 men 
are expected to die from it; 
Whereas the likelihood that a man will develop prostate can-
cer is 1 in 8; 
Whereas an estimated 248,530 men will be diagnosed with 
prostate cancer in 2021, and an estimated 34,130 of 
them will die from the disease; 
Whereas African-American men in the United States have the 
highest incidence of prostate cancer; 
Whereas significant numbers of male-related health problems, 
such as prostate cancer, testicular cancer, infertility, and 
colon cancer, could be detected and treated if men’s 
awareness of such problems were more pervasive; 
Whereas educating both the public and health care providers

screens, in conjunction with clinical examination and self- 
testing for problems such as testicular cancer, can result 
in the detection of many of these problems in their early 
stages and increases in the survival rates to nearly 100 
percent; 
Whereas women are twice as likely as men to visit the doctor 
for annual examinations and preventive services; 
Whereas men are less likely than women to visit their health 
center or physician for regular screening examinations of
