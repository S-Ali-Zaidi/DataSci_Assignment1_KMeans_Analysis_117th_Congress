and indigenous music from across the United States,

ethnicities, religions, locations, political affiliations, and 
socioeconomic statuses, which demonstrates the melting- 
pot quality of Hip Hop art and culture; 
Whereas the art and culture of Hip Hop have been adapted 
in many innovative forms that are inspirational, chal-
lenging, humorous, thought-provoking, and spiritual;
