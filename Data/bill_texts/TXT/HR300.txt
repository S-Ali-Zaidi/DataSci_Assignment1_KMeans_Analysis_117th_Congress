H. RES. 300 
Expressing support for the designation of April 8, 2021, as ‘‘Remanufacturing 
Day’’. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
APRIL 8, 2021 
Ms. STEVENS submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Oversight and Reform 
RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of April 8, 2021, 
as ‘‘Remanufacturing Day’’. 
Whereas remanufacturing is a comprehensive and rigorous 
industrial process by which a previously sold, leased, 
used, worn, or nonfunctional product or part is returned 
to a ‘‘like-new’’ or ‘‘better-than-new’’ condition, from 
both a quality and performance perspective, through a 
controlled, reproducible, and sustainable process; 
Whereas a 2012 United States International Trade Commis-
sion report found that remanufacturers support at least 
180,000 full-time jobs in the United States, and further 
states that production of remanufactured goods in the 
United States increased by 15 percent from 2009 to 
2011 and exports totaled $11.2 billion annually;

Whereas remanufacturing has been recognized by leading 
universities, research institutions, and manufacturers in 
the United States as good for the environment for its 
ability to divert end-of-life products from landfills; 
Whereas by encouraging businesses, State agencies, nonprofit 
organizations, schools, and individuals to celebrate Re-
manufacturing Day 2021, we can further promote re-
manufacturing as environmentally friendly and economi-
cally smart; and 
Whereas to focus the Nation’s attention on the benefits of re-
manufacturing, businesses, educational institutions, and 
nonprofit organizations have joined together to celebrate 
Remanufacturing Day and are encouraging their col-
leagues, friends, families, and communities to learn more 
about the benefits of remanufactured products: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports 
1
the designation of ‘‘Remanufacturing Day’’.
