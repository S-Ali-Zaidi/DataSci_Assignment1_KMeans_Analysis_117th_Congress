consin, Ms. JACKSON LEE, Ms. OMAR, Mrs. LAWRENCE, and Ms. NOR-

mittee on Oversight and Reform 
RESOLUTION 
Addressing the hardships and disparities faced by Black 
women in order to encourage more inclusive policymaking. 
Whereas throughout United States history, the country’s 
economy was built in large part upon Black women’s di-
minished power, through unpaid, exploited, and forced 
labor; 
Whereas income gaps, wealth gaps, lack of adequate worker 
protection laws, and a host of other socioeconomic indica-
tors illustrate a system that has been designed to keep 
Black women without power; 
Whereas Black women made up 6.4 percent of the United 
States workforce in 2020, but represent 10.4 percent of

the workers who would benefit from raising the minimum 
wage to just $15 an hour; 
Whereas economic insecurity is intensified for Black women, 
who have little to no wealth to fall back on due to 
generational inequality and ongoing discrimination; 
Whereas discriminatory features of the United States labor 
market and the punitive design of public benefits pro-
grams hinder the economic mobility of Black women with 
disabilities; 
Whereas, in 2019, the median wealth for Black women was 
$1,700, while the median wealth for White women was 
$81,200, and the median wealth for White men was 
$78,200; 
Whereas Black women’s median annual earnings for full-time 
year-round work in 2020 was $43,209, while the median 
annual earning for a full-time, year-round White, non- 
Hispanic man was $67,629; 
Whereas 4.7 percent of Black women overall report serious 
psychological distress, and this rate nearly doubles for 
Black people living in poverty; 
Whereas studies show that Black women, whether insured or 
uninsured, receive worse care by health care profes-
sionals, often at the expense of their lives; 
Whereas, in 2020, more than 30 percent of Black women re-
lied on Medicaid as their primary source of health cov-
erage; 
Whereas Black women have been denied access to safe and 
affordable housing through the current rental housing 
market and Federal housing assistance programs;

•HRES 1050 IH 
Whereas racist and sexist Federal policies have denied Black 
women access to safe and affordable housing in both 
home ownership and rental markets, rendering them 
more likely to be cost-burdened and face eviction; 
Whereas Black college graduates owe an average of $25,000 
more in student loan debt than White college graduates; 
Whereas Black women are less likely to have wealth, to own 
a home, to hold retirement savings, and to receive inher-
itances and other family financial support; 
Whereas guaranteed income, direct cash transfers, hazard 
pay, an increase in worker power, sectoral worker bar-
gaining, and stronger labor law protection can benefit the 
economic well-being of marginalized demographics, spe-
cifically Black women; 
Whereas policymakers must provide robust, permanent, dedi-
cated funding for home and community-based services to 
protect the right of Black women with disabilities to re-
ceive care within their homes and communities; 
Whereas Black women not only need access to health care 
providers that value their identity, but also providers who 
look like them to improve Black women’s access to qual-
ity care; 
Whereas we must eliminate the school-to-prison pipeline for 
Black girls and prioritize restorative justice in lieu of po-
licing in schools and our communities to promote equi-
table academic success; 
Whereas expanding the child tax credit and earned income 
tax credit, incentivizing State tax changes, and strength-
ening the estate tax can assist in centering Black women 
in tax reform;

•HRES 1050 IH 
Whereas critical legislation such as H.R. 6268, the Protect 
Black Women and Girls Act, establishes a Task Force to 
examine the conditions and experiences of Black women 
and girls to identify and assess the efficacy of policies 
and programs designed to improve outcomes for Black 
women; and 
Whereas the Black Women Best (BWB) framework, as de-
signed by Janelle Jones, offers the blueprint to adopt a 
more innovative and equitable approach to center the 
lived experiences of Black women in policymaking: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the need to use policy frameworks 
2
similar to the Black Women Best (BWB) framework 
3
to center the lived experience of Black women in the 
4
policymaking process in order to ensure a more 
5
equal and just future for all; 
6
(2) encourages the use of this framework and 
7
those that complement it as a guideline to create 
8
and implement better public policies to benefit all 
9
people, and specifically Black women; and 
10
(3) considers legislative proposals presented in 
11
the Congressional Caucus on Black Women and 
12
Girls March report, ‘‘An Economy for All: Building 
13
a ‘Black Women Best’ Legislative Agenda’’ to repair 
14
the historical disparities that Black women endure 
15
and to secure an economy that works for everyone.
