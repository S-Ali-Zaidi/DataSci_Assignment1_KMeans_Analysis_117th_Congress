Whereas each student deserves to learn in an environment 
that is physically and emotionally safe; 
Whereas each student deserves to be actively engaged in 
learning and connected to the school and broader commu-
nity; 
Whereas the consequences of not ensuring that our young 
people are challenged, supported, healthy, safe, and en-
gaged are clear; 
Whereas the average graduation rate for United States stu-
dents rose to 85 percent in 2016–2017, but the gradua-
tion rate the same year for students with disabilities was 
only 67 percent, the rate for English language learners 
was 66 percent, and the rate for economically disadvan-
taged students was 78 percent; 
Whereas the National Academy of Medicine recommends all 
youth be active for 60 minutes each day, and higher aca-
demic 
achievement, 
lower 
absenteeism, 
and 
lower 
incidences of obesity are associated with daily physical 
activity; 
Whereas most students consume as many as half their meals 
in school, schools play a crucial role in teaching children 
about healthy lifestyles, and students who have access to 
nutritious school foods and opportunities to learn about 
healthy foods are less likely to be absent and are more 
attentive in school; 
Whereas students who feel unsafe in school are more prone 
to truancy and disruptive behaviors, have lower grades, 
and may drop out of school entirely, and according to the 
Indicators of School Crime and Safety report of 2018, 79 
percent of public schools reported one or more incidents 
of violence, theft, or other crimes from 2015 to 2016,

and 20 percent of middle and high school students re-
ported being bullied during the 2017 school year; 
Whereas the Department of Education’s Office for Civil 
Rights released a report entitled ‘‘Education in a Pan-
demic: The Disparate Impacts of COVID–19 on Amer-
ica’s Students’’, which highlights how the current public 
health crisis has disrupted our Nation’s education system 
and exacerbated longstanding inequities in school sys-
tems; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has widened disparities in 
education, including in the areas of access to technology, 
behavioral health services, and other aids and services, 
which have disproportionately affected students of color, 
English-language learners, students with disabilities, and 
students from low-income families; and 
Whereas the Partnership for 21st Century Skills reports that 
future employees must know how to communicate, col-
laborate, be creative, and think critically: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
