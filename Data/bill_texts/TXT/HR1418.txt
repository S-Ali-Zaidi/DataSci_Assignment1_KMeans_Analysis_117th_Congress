Whereas there are between 3,000 and 4,000 animal shelters 
throughout the United States in need of medical supplies, 
blankets, towels, cleaning supplies, food, and educational 
materials about owning a pet; 
Whereas increased knowledge and awareness of animal rescue 
programs throughout the United States will significantly 
reduce the number of cats and dogs euthanized and re-
duce the number of animals returned to a shelter who 
have been rescued; 
Whereas loving families welcome pets to their new ‘‘forever 
home’’ every day, but more adoption is needed; 
Whereas lowering the number of animals in need of rescue, 
by spaying and neutering, can help alleviate the over-
crowding of the Nation’s shelters; 
Whereas supporting families’ access to housing and veteri-
nary care can further reduce the number of pets surren-
dered or abandoned; 
Whereas years of animal abandonment has left thousands of 
homeless pets in overpopulated shelters and rescues; 
Whereas Charlie, one of the thousands of beagles rescued 
from a breeding facility this year, now has a bright fu-
ture in the laps of his loving new family; 
Whereas a ‘‘National Animal Rescue Day’’ would encourage 
the adoption of rescue animals into loving homes; and 
Whereas the first Saturday in October would be an appro-
priate day to designate as ‘‘National Animal Rescue 
Day’’ to be celebrated through adoption events, festivals, 
and charitable giving which will increase revenues for 
shelters and pet adoptions: Now, therefore, be it
