RESOLUTION 
Condemning the horrific attack on November 19, 2022, at 
Club Q, honoring the memories of those who were mur-
dered, and offering support to all who were impacted. 
Whereas, on November 19, 2022, on the eve of Transgender 
Day of Remembrance, a shooter murdered at least 5 peo-
ple and injured at least 22 people at Club Q, an 
LGBTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado; 
Whereas just 6 years earlier, a gunman opened fire and mur-
dered 49 people at another LGBTQ+ nightclub, the 
Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in what was then 
the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history; 
Whereas LGBTQ+ nightclubs often serve as a place of affir-
mation and refuge for LGBTQ+ people; 
Whereas the shooting at Club Q occurred the day before the 
club had planned to host a drag brunch for Transgender 
Day of Remembrance; 
Whereas extremist anti-LGBTQ+ politicians increasingly tar-
get drag events and spread lies about LGBTQ+ people, 
focusing often on transgender and nonbinary youth, 
falsely accusing them of criminal intentions or acts; 
Whereas anti-LGBTQ+ extremists have further spread lies 
and disinformation demonizing the LGBTQ+ commu-
nity, especially the transgender and nonbinary commu-
nity and those who support them, on social media plat-
forms; 
Whereas LGBTQ+ people and the people who support them 
have faced increasingly violent threats in the past year;

•HRES 1522 IH 
Whereas State legislators introduced more than 300 anti- 
LGBTQ+ bills this session, and 25 of them were signed 
into law; 
Whereas the toxic combination of hate and access to guns 
can and has led to deadly results; 
Whereas in the face of harassment, threats, and violence, the 
LGBTQ+ community has continued to show resiliency; 
and 
Whereas all LGBTQ+ people deserve to live their lives open-
ly without fear of hate and violence: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) condemns the horrific attack on November
