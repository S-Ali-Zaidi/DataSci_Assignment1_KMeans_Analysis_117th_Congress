Whereas warehouse workers work around the clock, with little 
to no rest, all while too often being the victims of wage 
theft and the lowest paid workers, with no retirement or 
medical benefits; 
Whereas warehouse workers in the summer months work in 
dangerously hot conditions, and as a result of working 
around the clock to meet the demand, warehouse workers 
can suffer from muscle cramps, sweat through their 
clothes, become dehydrated, and feel faint; 
Whereas warehouses in the Inland Empire manage distribu-
tion for most goods traveling through the Los Angeles 
and Long Beach ports, which receive 40 percent of the 
Nation’s imports; 
Whereas warehousing positions in the Inland Empire grew 28 
percent between February 2020 and October 2021; 
Whereas there are nearly 2,000,000 warehouse workers in 
the United States; and 
Whereas warehouse workers help individuals and communities 
through— 
(1) assisting in the supply chain; 
(2) helping to transport goods; and 
(3) packing, processing, and moving inventory: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals of ‘‘Warehouse Worker 
2
Recognition Week’’; 
3
(2) encourages increased awareness of the con-
4
tributions of warehouse workers;
