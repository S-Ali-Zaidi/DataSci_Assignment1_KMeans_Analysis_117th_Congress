RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the designation of the week of April 11 through 
April 17, 2021, as ‘‘Black Maternal Health Week’’ to 
bring national attention to the maternal health crisis 
in the United States and the importance of reducing 
maternal mortality and morbidity among Black women 
and birthing persons. 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, Black women in the United States are three 
to four times more likely than White women to die from 
pregnancy-related causes; 
Whereas Black women in the United States suffer from life- 
threatening pregnancy complications, known as ‘‘mater-
nal morbidities’’, twice as often as White women; 
Whereas maternal mortality rates in the United States are— 
(1) among the highest in the developed world; and 
(2) increasing rapidly; 
Whereas the United States has the highest maternal mor-
tality rate among affluent countries, in part because of 
the disproportionate mortality rate of Black women; 
Whereas Black women are 49 percent more likely than all 
other women to deliver prematurely; 
Whereas the high rates of maternal mortality among Black 
women span across— 
(1) income levels; 
(2) education levels; and 
(3) socioeconomic status; 
Whereas structural racism, gender oppression, and the social 
determinants of health inequities experienced by Black 
women in the United States significantly contribute to

the disproportionately high rates of maternal mortality 
and morbidity among Black women; 
Whereas racism and discrimination play a consequential role 
in maternal health care experiences and outcomes of 
Black birthing people; 
Whereas a fair and wide distribution of resources and birth 
options, especially with regard to reproductive health care 
services and maternal health programming, are critical to 
closing the racial gap in maternal health outcomes; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has further highlighted 
issues within the broken health care system in the United 
States and the harm of that system to Black women and 
birthing persons by exposing— 
(1) increased barriers to accessing prenatal and 
postpartum care, including maternal mental health care; 
(2) lack of uniform hospital policies permitting 
doulas and support persons to be present during labor 
and delivery; 
(3) inconsistent hospital policies regarding the sepa-
ration of the newborn from a mother that is suspected 
positive for COVID–19; 
(4) complexities in COVID–19 vaccine drug trials 
including pregnant people; 
(5) increased rates of Cesarean section deliveries; 
(6) shortened hospital stays following delivery; 
(7) provider shortages and lack of sufficient policies 
to allow home births attended by midwives; 
(8) insufficient practical support for delivery of care 
by midwives, including telehealth access; 
(9) adverse economic impact on Black mothers and 
families due to job loss or reduction in income during 
quarantine and the pandemic recession; and

(10) pervasive racial injustice against Black people 
in the criminal justice, social, and health care systems; 
Whereas, even as there is growing concern about improving 
access to mental health services, Black women are least 
likely to have access to mental health screenings, treat-
ment, and support before, during, and after pregnancy; 
Whereas justice-informed, culturally congruent models of care 
are beneficial to Black women; and 
Whereas an investment must be made in— 
(1) maternity care for Black women and birthing 
persons, including support of care led by the communities 
most affected by the maternal health crisis in the United 
States; 
(2) continuous health insurance coverage to support 
Black women and birthing persons for the full postpar-
tum period up to at least one year after giving birth; and 
(3) policies that support and promote affordable, 
comprehensive, and holistic maternal health care that is 
free from gender and racial discrimination, regardless of 
incarceration: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
1
nizes that— 
2
(1) Black women are experiencing high, dis-
3
proportionate rates of maternal mortality and mor-
4
bidity in the United States; 
5
(2) the alarmingly high rates of maternal mor-
6
tality among Black women are unacceptable;
