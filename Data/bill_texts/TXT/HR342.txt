IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
APRIL 22, 2021 
Mr. CRAWFORD submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce 
RESOLUTION 
Recognizing that Mississippi County, Arkansas, is the leader 
in electric arc furnace steel production. 
Whereas Mississippi County, Arkansas, is America’s largest 
producer of sustainable, recycled, scrap-based steel; 
Whereas Mississippi County’s steel industry has been built on 
a sustainable model of recycling steel to produce new 
steel and steel products that are 100-percent recyclable 
at the end of their useful life; 
Whereas Mississippi County’s steel producers utilize electric 
arc furnaces (EAFs) that melt recycled scrap and turn 
it into new steel; 
Whereas the EAF steelmaking process is far less carbon-in-
tensive and more energy efficient;

•HRES 342 IH 
Whereas EAF steel producers in Arkansas produce steel with 
up to 75 percent fewer carbon emissions than traditional 
steelmaking; 
Whereas with lower carbon emissions and less energy re-
quired, the recycled steel produced in Mississippi County 
makes the county a building block for a green economy; 
Whereas Mississippi County’s steel producers are recycling 
the steel of the past and using it to build America’s fu-
ture; 
Whereas Mississippi County is home to the only steel produc-
tion facility to be LEED certified; 
Whereas Mississippi County’s modern steel producers con-
tinue to push recycled steel into products where it was 
never considered viable, such as 3d Generation Advanced 
High-Strength Steel (AHSS) products that make lighter, 
stronger, and more fuel-efficient vehicles with lower 
lifecycle emissions; 
Whereas 100 percent of Mississippi County’s steel is made in 
lower emissions, recycled, scrap-based EAFs, compared 
to only 28 percent of steel produced in the world and 10 
percent of steel produced in China being made in EAFs; 
and 
Whereas through recycling, Mississippi County is one of the 
cleanest places on Earth to make steel: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
1
nizes that Mississippi County, Arkansas, is the leader in 
2
electric arc furnace steel production.
