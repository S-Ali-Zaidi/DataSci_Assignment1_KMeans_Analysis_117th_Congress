Whereas it is in the national security interests of the United 
States to control its own energy supply; 
Whereas the Biden administration’s Executive actions lim-
iting the productivity of American energy producers in 
the oil and natural gas sectors are putting at risk the 
United States goal of securing its energy future; and 
Whereas the American energy sector is more heavily regu-
lated in the United States from an environmental and 
safety perspective than anywhere else in the world: Now, 
therefore, be it
