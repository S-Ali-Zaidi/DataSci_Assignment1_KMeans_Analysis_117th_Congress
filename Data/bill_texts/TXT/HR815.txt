Whereas rural health facilities in the United States have 
faced systemic challenges, including low reimbursements, 
physician workforce shortages, and difficulty accessing 
certain technologies like telehealth; 
Whereas these challenges have contributed to 138 rural hos-
pital closures since 2010; 
Whereas these challenges have made it more difficult for all 
rural health care facilities to keep their doors open and 
serve patients; 
Whereas National Rural Health Day was established to em-
phasize the importance of rural areas of the United 
States and recognize the efforts and contributions to ad-
dress the unique challenges in rural health care; 
Whereas the National Organization of State Offices of Rural 
Health has recognized National Rural Health Day the 
third Thursday of each November since 2010; and 
Whereas National Rural Health Day will be celebrated this 
year on November 18, 2021: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
