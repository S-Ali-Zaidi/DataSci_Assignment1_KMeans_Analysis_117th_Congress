riod every month for decades of their lives;

Whereas 16,900,000 individuals in the United States report 
lacking access to menstrual products; 
Whereas national surveys and research studies report that 1 
in 4 menstruators struggle to secure enough period prod-
ucts to meet their monthly needs due to lack of income; 
Whereas this lack of period supplies, known as period pov-
erty, can adversely affect people’s health and well-being; 
Whereas 1 in 5 women and girls reports missing work or 
school as a result of period poverty; 
Whereas period poverty exacerbates the vicious cycle of pov-
erty by forcing menstruators to withdraw from daily life, 
losing pay or missing educational opportunities; 
Whereas people experiencing period poverty risk infections by 
using proxy products, such as socks or toilet paper, or 
not changing products as often as medically advised; 
Whereas when students can easily access period products 
they are less likely to face disruptions to their education 
and better able to participate in educational activities; 
Whereas States and communities across the United States 
are recognizing the importance of providing period prod-
ucts to students in order to support their educational and 
personal development; and 
Whereas providing access to period products in schools and 
other public locations can lead to economic opportunity 
and improved health by ensuring all people have access 
to the basic necessities required to thrive and reach their 
full potential: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
