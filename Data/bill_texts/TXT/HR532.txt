Whereas Spanish explorers established four colonies in Pensa-
cola Bay which were either destroyed by invaders or hur-
ricanes that ravaged the settlements before the final col-
ony of San Miguel de Panzacola was established in mod-
ern, downtown Pensacola; 
Whereas after Spain ceded Florida to the United States, Gov-
ernor Andrew Jackson established a government that en-
abled Escambia County to prosper and play a vital role 
in the fabric of American cultural elements through its 
newspapers, circuses, and health care; and 
Whereas Escambia County has commemorated this history 
with a five-month-long educational celebration and time 
capsule that will memorialize the heritage of Escambia 
and act as a memorial to its current historical era: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives com-
1
memorates the 200th birthday of Escambia County.
