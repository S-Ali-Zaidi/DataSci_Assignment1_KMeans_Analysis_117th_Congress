117TH CONGRESS 
1ST SESSION 
H. RES. 551 
Expressing support for the designation of August 1, 2021, as ‘‘Gold Star 
Children’s Day’’. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
JULY 22, 2021 
Mr. PHILLIPS (for himself, Mrs. KIM of California, Mr. RYAN, and Mr. KELLY 
of Mississippi) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
the Committee on Armed Services 
RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of August 1, 2021, 
as ‘‘Gold Star Children’s Day’’. 
Whereas the recognition of Gold Star Families in the United 
States dates back to World War I, when the families of 
fallen service members displayed a service flag in the win-
dow of their homes with a gold star; 
Whereas in 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed 
into law legislation declaring Gold Star Mother’s Day, a 
national observance honoring the mothers of fallen serv-
ice members annually on the last Sunday of September; 
Whereas since 2010, the Senate has honored Gold Star 
Spouses by resolution annually on April 5, recognizing 
the unique sacrifices made by spouses of fallen service 
members;

Whereas thousands of sons and daughters of military families 
have lost mothers or fathers who served in the Armed 
Forces and also deserve national recognition for the bur-
den and legacy they carry; and 
Whereas no date has existed to specifically recognize the chil-
dren of fallen service members of the United States as 
part of a national debt of gratitude that the people of the 
United States owe to the service members who sacrificed 
all in protecting the freedom of the United States and 
the people of the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘Gold Star Chil-
2
dren’s Day’’; 
3
(2) honors the sacrifices and hardships of the 
4
children of fallen service members; and 
5
(3) encourages the people of the United States 
6
to observe ‘‘Gold Star Children’s Day’’ in support of 
7
children of the fallen men and women of the Armed 
8
Forces of the United States.
