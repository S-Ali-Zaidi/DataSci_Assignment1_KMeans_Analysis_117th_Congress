RESOLUTION 
Raising awareness for the cancer chordoma. 
Whereas chordoma is a slow growing, yet aggressive bone 
cancer of the skull and spine; 
Whereas it strikes people of all ages and affects more than 
25,000 individuals worldwide; 
Whereas each year, thousands of people are diagnosed with 
chordoma including about 300 people annually in the 
United States; 
Whereas chordomas are among the most complicated tumors 
to treat due to involvement of critical structures such as 
the brain stem, spinal cord, and important nerves and ar-
teries;

•HRES 1514 IH 
Whereas surgery or radiation performed by a skilled treat-
ment team can be curative for some patients, but even 
with the best care possible, the recurrence rate remains 
high; and 
Whereas no drugs are known to cure or effectively control the 
disease, meaning that patients whose disease progresses 
after exhausting surgical and radiation options have little 
hope for a full recovery: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that chordoma patients and families need in-
2
creased funding and support for— 
3
(1) accurate and early diagnosis; 
4
(2) 
the 
development 
of 
new 
treatments, 
5
diagnostics, and cures; 
6
(3) fewer hurdles between research and new 
7
treatments; and 
8
(4) patient-centric approaches to drug discovery

and development.
