children ages 3 to 17 reported a mental, emotional, devel-
opmental, or behavioral disorder; 
Whereas the effects of COVID–19 have been well-docu-
mented, and the need for mental health and suicide pre-
vention services only continues to grow; 
Whereas the ‘‘Stress in America 2021: Stress and Decision- 
Making during the Pandemic’’ poll found that— 
(1) 1 in 3 adults (32 percent) are so stressed about

for children; 
Whereas the impact of the pandemic on individuals, felt 
through the disruption of their lives, increased anxiety 
about the virus, and the death of loved ones, has had a 
traumatic effect;

chronic conditions, and without proper diagnosis and 
treatment children can face problems at home and in 
school, and mental health disorders can interfere with

should be utilized to focus on prevention and early inter-
vention in the educational system, as that is where chil-
dren are most likely to receive mental health services;

adulthood if left untreated; 
Whereas disparities remain in access to mental health treat-
ment for youth of color, with Asian, Native American,
