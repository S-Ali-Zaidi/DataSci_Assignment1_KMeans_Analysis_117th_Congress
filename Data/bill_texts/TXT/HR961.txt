•HRES 961 IH 
Whereas the right of people to petition their Government is 
severely hindered by the closure of the Capitol and the 
people’s House; 
Whereas the Capitol had only been closed briefly 3 times 
since the beginning of the 20th century: during the Span-
ish flu pandemic, after the assassination of Rev. Martin 
Luther King, Jr., and after the September 11 and an-
thrax attacks in 2001; 
Whereas this is the longest closure of the Capitol in history, 
with no end in sight; 
Whereas, while the public is still unable to use the Capitol 
Visitor Center, the vast majority of State capitols across 
the country are open to the public; 
Whereas schools are operating in person safely around the 
country; and 
Whereas sporting events are being widely attended safely 
around the country: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, 
That the House of Representatives
