RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the forthcoming centennial of the 1921 Tulsa 
Race Massacre. 
Whereas, in the early 20th century, de jure segregation con-
fined Tulsa’s Black residents into the ‘‘Greenwood Dis-
trict’’, which they built into a thriving community with 
a nationally renowned entrepreneurial center known as 
the ‘‘Black Wall Street’’; 
Whereas, at the time, White supremacy and racist violence 
were common throughout the United States and went 
largely unchecked by the justice system; 
Whereas reports of an alleged and disputed incident on the 
morning of May 30, 1921, between two teenagers, a 
Black man and a White woman, caused the White com-
munity of Tulsa, including the Tulsa Tribune, to call for 
a lynching amidst a climate of White racial hostility and 
White resentment over Black economic success; 
Whereas, on May 31, 1921, a mob of armed White men de-
scended upon Tulsa’s Greenwood District and launched 
what is now known as the ‘‘Tulsa Race Massacre’’; 
Whereas Tulsa municipal and county authorities failed to 
take actions to calm or contain the violence, and civil and 
law enforcement officials deputized many White men who 
were participants in the violence as their agents, directly 
contributing to the violence through overt and often ille-
gal acts; 
Whereas, over a period of 24 hours, the White mob’s violence 
led to the death of an estimated 300 Black residents, as 
well as over 800 reports of injuries;

•HRES 215 IH 
Whereas the White mob looted, damaged, burned, or other-
wise destroyed approximately 40 square blocks of the 
Greenwood district, including an estimated 1,256 homes 
of Black residents, as well as virtually every other struc-
ture, including churches, schools, businesses, a hospital, 
and a library, leaving nearly 9,000 Black Tulsans home-
less and effectively wiping out tens of millions of dollars 
in Black prosperity and wealth in Tulsa; 
Whereas, in the wake of the Tulsa Race Massacre, the Gov-
ernor of Oklahoma declared martial law, and units of the 
Oklahoma National Guard participated in the mass ar-
rests of all or nearly all of Greenwood’s surviving resi-
dents, removing them from Greenwood to other parts of 
Tulsa and unlawfully detaining them in holding centers; 
Whereas Oklahoma local and State governments dismissed 
claims arising from the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre for 
decades, and the event was effectively erased from collec-
tive memory and history until, in 1997, the Oklahoma 
State Legislature finally created a commission to study 
the event; 
Whereas, on February 28, 2001, the commission issued a re-
port that detailed, for the first time, the extent of the 
Massacre and decades-long efforts to suppress its recol-
lection; 
Whereas none of the law enforcement officials nor any of the 
hundreds of other White mob members who participated 
in the violence were ever prosecuted or held accountable 
for the hundreds of lives lost and tens of millions of dol-
lars of Black wealth destroyed, despite the Tulsa Race 
Massacre Commission confirming their roles in the Mas-
sacre, nor was any compensation ever provided to the 
Massacre’s victims or their descendants;

•HRES 215 IH 
Whereas government and city officials not only abdicated 
their responsibility to rebuild and repair the Greenwood 
community in the wake of the violence, but actively 
blocked efforts to do so, contributing to continued racial 
disparities in Tulsa akin to those that Black people face 
across the United States; 
Whereas the pattern of violence against Black people in the 
United States, often at the hands of law enforcement, 
shows that the fight to end State-sanctioned violence 
against Black people continues; and 
Whereas the year 2021 marks the 100th anniversary of the 
Tulsa Race Massacre: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes the forthcoming centennial of the 
2
Tulsa Race Massacre; 
3
(2) acknowledges the historical significance of 
4
this event as one of the largest single instances of 
5
State-sanctioned violence against Black people in 
6
American history; 
7
(3) honors the lives and legacies of the esti-
8
mated 300 Black individuals who were killed during 
9
the Massacre and the nearly 9,000 Black individuals 
10
who were left homeless and penniless; 
11
(4) condemns the participants of the Tulsa 
12
Race Massacre, including White municipal officials 
13
and law enforcement who directly participated in or 
14
who aided and abetted the unlawful violence;

(5) condemns past and present efforts to cover 
1
up the truth and shield the White community, and 
2
especially State and local officials, from account-
3
ability for the Tulsa Race Massacre and other in-
4
stances of violence at the hands of law enforcement; 
5
(6) condemns the continued legacy of racism, 
6
including systemic racism, and White supremacy 
7
against Black people in the United States, particu-
8
larly in the form of police brutality; 
9
(7) encourages education about the Tulsa Race 
10
Massacre, including the horrors of the massacre 
11
itself, the history of White supremacy that fueled the 
12
massacre, and subsequent attempts to deny or cover 
13
up the Massacre, in all elementary and secondary 
14
education settings and in institutions of higher edu-
15
cation in the United States; and 
16
(8) recognizes the commitment of Congress to 
17
acknowledge and learn from the history of racism 
18
and racial violence in the United States, including 
19
the Tulsa Race Massacre, to reverse the legacy of 
20
White supremacy and fight for racial justice.
