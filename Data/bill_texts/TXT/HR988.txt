RESOLUTION 
Calling for justice and accountability for the perpetrators 
of the bombing of the Embassy of Israel in Buenos 
Aires on March 17, 1992. 
Whereas, 30 years ago, on March 17, 1992, the Embassy of 
Israel in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was the target of a 
horrific terrorist suicide bombing; 
Whereas Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack in 
which 29 were murdered, including Israeli diplomats, 
their relatives, and numerous Argentines, including chil-
dren from a nearby school; 
Whereas 242 people were seriously wounded in the attack, in-
cluding some who were unable to recover from their inju-
ries; 
Whereas, in 1999, the Supreme Court of Argentina found 
that the transnational terrorist organization Hezbollah 
was responsible for the bombing and issued an arrest 
warrant for the arrest of Hezbollah commander Imad 
Mughnieh; 
Whereas 2 years after the bombing of the Embassy of Israel 
in Argentina, on July 18, 1994, 85 people were killed in 
a similar Hezbollah terrorist attack on the Argentine- 
Israeli Mutual Association building in Buenos Aires; 
Whereas Hezbollah operatives planned both attacks in the 
triborder area of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay; 
Whereas evidence demonstrates that the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, fa-
cilitated and financed the execution of these terrorist at-
tacks;
