CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the significance of equal pay and the disparity 
in wages paid to Latina women in comparison to men. 
Whereas October 21, 2021, is ‘‘Latina Equal Pay Day’’, 
which marks the day that symbolizes how long into 2021 
Latina women, on average, must work to make what 
White, non-Hispanic men were paid in 2020; 
Whereas section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(d)(1)) prohibits discrimination in 
wages on the basis of sex for equal work; 
Whereas title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 
2000e et seq.) prohibits discrimination in compensation 
because of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex; 
Whereas, despite the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 
(29 U.S.C. 206 note) more than five decades ago, which 
establishes that employers shall not discriminate in wages 
on the basis of sex, but shall provide equal pay for equal 
work, Census Bureau data shows that Latina women 
working full-time, year-round are typically paid 57 cents 
for every dollar paid to White, non-Hispanic men; 
Whereas as a study conducted in 2019 found that on aver-
age, Latina women lose over $1,100,000 in potential 
earnings over their lifetime to the wage gap; 
Whereas the median annual pay for a Latina woman in the 
United States working full-time, year-round was $38,718 
in 2020, placing a working mother with two children near 
poverty; 
Whereas job loss during the pandemic distorted measure-
ments of average wages as women with lower earnings in

sectors such as leisure, hospitality, and retail were more 
likely to experience job loss and leave the labor force; 
Whereas the Latina unemployment rate peaked at 20.1 per-
cent in April 2020, and the Latina civilian labor force 
participation rate fell from a high of 59.2 percent in Oc-
tober 2019 to 57 percent in September 2020; 
Whereas lost wages mean Latina women have less money to 
support themselves and their families, save and invest for 
the future, and spend on goods and services; 
Whereas 51 percent of Latinas are unable to earn sick days 
through their jobs; 
Whereas more than half of Latina low-wage earners report 
that they spent most or all of their savings during the 
pandemic, and 32 percent have no money left for emer-
gencies, compared to 13 percent of White men; 
Whereas the lack of affordable, accessible childcare during 
the COVID–19 pandemic led 14 percent of Latinas, and 
32 percent of immigrant Latinas, to quit their jobs or re-
duce their number of work hours to care for their chil-
dren; 
Whereas the underpayment of Latina workers causes busi-
nesses and the economy to suffer; 
Whereas the lack of access to affordable, quality childcare, 
paid family and medical leave, and other family friendly 
workplace policies forces many Latina women to choose 
between their paycheck or job and getting quality care 
for themselves or their family members, a dynamic that 
contributes to the wage gap and has been further exacer-
bated by the COVID–19 pandemic, especially as Latina 
women disproportionately work in essential jobs that put 
them at greater risk of exposure to COVID–19;

Whereas, if the wage gap were eliminated, on average, a 
Latina woman working full-time, year-round would have 
enough money for approximately 3 years of childcare, to 
pay off her student debt in 1 year, or to pay off 19 
months of the average mortgage payment; 
Whereas 25 to 85 percent of women have been sexually har-
assed at the workplace, and research has found that only 
a small number of those who experience harassment, or 
about 1 in 10, formally report incidents for reasons in-
cluding lack of access to the complaint process and fear 
of retaliation; 
Whereas workplace harassment forces many women to leave 
their occupation or industry, as targets of harassment are 
6.5 times as likely as nontargets to change jobs, or pass 
up opportunities for advancement, and this contributes to 
the gender wage gap; 
Whereas there is a high personal cost for women who have 
been sexually harassed, including unemployment, under-
employment, and financial stress resulting from changing 
jobs, which lead to long-term consequences for earnings 
and career attainment; 
Whereas two-thirds of workers paid the minimum wage or 
less in 2020 were women, and there is a disproportionate 
concentration of women of color in low-wage and tipped 
jobs; 
Whereas the pay disparity Latina women face is part of a 
wider set of disparities Latina women face in home own-
ership, unemployment, poverty, access to childcare, and 
the ability to build wealth;

Whereas true pay equity requires a multifaceted strategy that 
addresses the gender and racial injustices that Latina 
women face daily; and 
Whereas many national organizations have designated Octo-
ber 21, 2021, as ‘‘Latina Equal Pay Day’’ to represent 
the additional time that Latina women must work into 
the next calendar year to receive the earnings of their 
White, non-Hispanic counterparts in the prior census 
year: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That Congress— 
2
(1) recognizes the disparity in wages paid to 
3
Latina women and its impact on women, families, 
4
the economy and our entire country; and 
5
(2) reaffirms its support for ensuring equal pay 
6
and closing the gender wage gap.
