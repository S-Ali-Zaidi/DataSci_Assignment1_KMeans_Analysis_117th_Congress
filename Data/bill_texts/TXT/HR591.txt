Whereas Wildfire Preparedness Week, like other designated 
weeks or days for natural disasters, promotes educational 
initiatives, encourages community programming, and in-
creases overall knowledge and preparedness; 
Whereas Wildfire Preparedness Week aligns with the State of 
California and President Biden’s suppression efforts 
through resource management and bolsters the economy 
by creating a more permanent firefighting workforce; 
Whereas firefighters are on the frontlines and are at an in-
creased risk of developing cancer and respiratory diseases 
because they are exposed to smoke and hazardous chemi-
cals in the line of duty; 
Whereas, in 2020, wildfires burned more than 4 million acres 
across California, over 1 million acres in Oregon, and 
over 840,000 acres in Washington; 
Whereas nearly 85 percent of wildland fires in the United 
States are caused by humans; 
Whereas from January 1, 2021, through July 14, 2021, there 
have been over 4,000 fires and over 142,000 acres 
burned in the United States; 
Whereas the wildfire season in California increases every year 
in length and frequency of fires; and 
Whereas preventative measures exist to help individuals and 
communities increase their fire resilience through— 
(1) evacuation planning; 
(2) vegetation and forest management; and 
(3) limited use of combustibles during high heat or 
drier seasons, including fireworks, exhaust, and open 
flames: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
