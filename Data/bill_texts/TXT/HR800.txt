RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the two-year anniversary of the November 2019

public of Iran. 
Whereas, on November 15, 2019, scattered protests through-
out Iran began over a surprise increase in gasoline prices; 
Whereas, by November 17, 2019, the unrest had reached the

burning pictures of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali 
Khamenei; 
Whereas after days of protests across Iran, Supreme Leader 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an order to ‘‘do whatever 
it takes to stop them’’; 
Whereas that order, confirmed by three sources close to the 
Supreme Leader’s inner circle and a fourth official, set 
in motion the bloodiest crackdown on protesters since the 
Islamic Revolution in 1979; 
Whereas nearly 1,500 people, including 17 children and over 
400 women, were killed during less than two weeks of un-
rest, as confirmed by three Iranian Ministry of the Inte-
rior officials; 
Whereas, on November 23, 2019, the former Special Rep-
resentative for Iran, Brian Hook, stated the ‘‘report on 
the massacre order by Khamenei underscores the urgency 
for the international community to punish the perpetra-
tors and isolate the regime for the murder of 1,500 Ira-
nian citizens’’; 
Whereas during President Donald Trump’s administration, 
the Department of State released an official report citing 
the death toll as 1,500; 
Whereas, in March 2021, the Department of State under the 
Biden administration released a revised report of the No-
vember 2019 protests that lowered the death toll from 
the confirmed 1,500 to a revised 304; 
Whereas the revised, smaller death toll of the November 2019 
massacre comes from Amnesty International, which has 
admitted that the assessment of casualties is incomplete; 
Whereas the move by the Biden administration underscores 
its commitment to appeasing the Iranian regime; and
