Whereas, before this rise in hate incidents, online hate speech 
against Asians increased 2,770 percent between 2019 
and 2020; 
Whereas the use of anti-Asian rhetoric related to COVID–19, 
such as the ‘‘Chinese virus’’, ‘‘Wuhan virus’’, and ‘‘kung 
flu’’, has perpetuated anti-Asian stigma that has resulted 
in Asian Americans being harassed, assaulted, and 
scapegoated for the COVID–19 pandemic and economic 
distress in the United States; 
Whereas the use of rhetoric that portrays Asian countries, 
and by extension Asian nationals, as enemies of the 
United States has further contributed to the scapegoating 
of Asian Americans and the rise in anti-Asian hate; 
Whereas xenophobic rhetoric that paints China as a unique 
and existential enemy or which seeks to make all of 
China responsible for the coronavirus, contrary to advice 
from the World Health Organization, contributes to anti- 
Asian hate; 
Whereas the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act, legislation to ad-
dress the rise of anti-Asian hate and improve hate crimes 
reporting, was passed with strong bipartisan support in 
both the House and Senate; and 
Whereas the people of the United States continue to remem-
ber the victims of these shootings and stand in solidarity 
with those affected by this senseless tragedy: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
