Whereas a ‘‘National Small Business Week’’ has been de-
clared by every President since 1963; 
Whereas there are more than 30 million small businesses in 
the United States that support nearly 60 million jobs; 
Whereas every congressional district in the United States 
contains a small business; 
Whereas thousands of small business establishments have 
been particularly hard hit by the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas small businesses will play an integral role in rebuild-
ing the economy of the Nation; 
Whereas Congress established the Small Business Adminis-
tration in 1953 to aid, counsel, assist, and protect inter-
ests of small business to ensure that a fair proportion of 
total purchases, contracts, and subcontracts for property 
and services for the Federal Government are placed with 
small businesses, to make certain access to critical capital 
is made available to such small businesses, and to main-
tain and strengthen the overall economy; 
Whereas the Small Business Administration has helped small 
businesses with access to critical lending opportunities, 
played a key role in ensuring full and open competition 
for government contracts, and improved the economic en-
vironment in which small businesses compete; and 
Whereas September 13, 2021, through September 17, 2021, 
would be an appropriate week to celebrate ‘‘National 
Small Business Week’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) honors and celebrates the entrepreneurial 
2
spirit and contributions of small businesses in every

community in the United States;
