H. Res. 626 
In the House of Representatives, U. S., 
September 10, 2021. 
Whereas, on September 11, 2001, while Americans were at-
tending to their daily routines, terrorists hijacked four ci-
vilian aircraft, crashing two of them into the towers of 
the World Trade Center in New York City, a third into 
the Pentagon near Washington, DC, and a fourth was 
prevented from also being used as a weapon against 
America by brave passengers who placed their country 
above their own lives; 
Whereas thousands of innocent Americans were killed and in-
jured as a result of these attacks, including the pas-
sengers and crew of the four aircraft, workers in the 
World Trade Center and in the Pentagon, rescue work-
ers, and bystanders; 
Whereas the crewmembers of United Flight 175, American 
Flight 11, American Flight 77, and United Flight 93 
acted as first responders, reporting the first intelligence 
of a war the United States did not know it was fighting 
and sacrificing their own lives to protect the United 
States and the lives of countless others; 
Whereas 20 years later the country continues to, and shall 
forever, mourn their tragic loss and honor their memory;

Whereas these attacks destroyed both towers of the World 
Trade Center, as well as adjacent buildings, and seriously 
damaged the Pentagon; 
Whereas these attacks were by far the deadliest terrorist at-
tacks ever launched against the United States, and, by 
targeting symbols of American strength and success, were 
intended to assail the principles, values, and freedoms of 
the United States and the American people, intimidate 
our Nation, and weaken its resolve; 
Whereas memorials have been constructed to honor the vic-
tims of these attacks at the Pentagon, in Shanksville, 
Pennsylvania, and on the World Trade Center grounds, 
so that Americans and people from around the world can 
visit to mourn those lost and to pay tribute to the heroic 
action and sacrifice of those who have served our commu-
nities and our country in the years since the attacks; 
Whereas 20 years after September 11, 2001, the United 
States continues to fight terrorists and other extremists 
who threaten America and her friends and allies; 
Whereas successive Congresses and administrations have as-
sisted victims of terrorism, protected our Nation, com-
bated terrorism at home and abroad, and supported the 
members of the Armed Forces who courageously defend 
the United States; 
Whereas by the tireless efforts of our intelligence, military, 
and law enforcement professionals, the United States has 
been able to significantly degrade the al Qaida network, 
by taking into custody or killing senior al Qaida leaders, 
operational managers, and key facilitators, and owes a 
debt of gratitude to the focused and persistent efforts of

all those personnel involved in the removal of Osama bin 
Laden; 
Whereas the terrorist attacks that have occurred around the 
world since September 11, 2001, remind us of the hateful 
inhumanity of terrorism and the ongoing threat it poses 
to freedom, justice, and the rule of law; 
Whereas United States law enforcement and intelligence 
agencies and allies of the United States around the world 
have worked together to detect and disrupt terrorist net-
works and numerous terror plots since September 11, 
2001; 
Whereas the Nation is indebted to the brave military, intel-
ligence, law enforcement, and civilian personnel serving 
around the world in advancement of United States na-
tional interests; 
Whereas thousands of families have lost loved ones in the de-
fense of freedom and liberty against the tyranny of ter-
ror; and 
Whereas the passage of 20 years has not diminished the pain 
caused by the senseless loss of nearly 3,000 persons 
killed on September 11, 2001: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
(1) recognizes September 11 as a day of solemn 
commemoration; 
(2) extends again its deepest sympathies to the 
thousands of innocent victims of the September 11, 
2001, terrorist attacks, and to their families, friends, 
and loved ones;

leaders and citizens of all nations who have assisted and 
continue to stand in solidarity with the United States 
against terrorism in the aftermath of the attacks on 
September 11, 2001, and asks them to continue to stand 
with the United States against international terrorism; 
(6) commends the military and intelligence per-
sonnel involved in the removal of Osama bin Laden;

tremism arrayed against American interests and to pro-
viding the United States military, intelligence, and law 
enforcement communities with the resources and support 
to do so effectively and safely;

and disrupt terrorists and their activities;

(9) reaffirms that the American people will never 
forget the sacrifices made on September 11, 2001, and 
will never bow to terrorist demands; and

stands adjourned out of respect to the victims of the ter-
rorist attacks.
