RESOLUTION 
Honoring the essential staff of the United States Capitol

daily to serve Members of Congress and staff regardless 
of political ideology, weather conditions, Government 
shutdowns, and more; 
Whereas essential staff are often underappreciated and over-
worked as they provide much needed services at the 
United States Capitol; 
Whereas the violent insurrection on January 6, 2021, left es-
sential staff fleeing for their lives, with many staff detail-
ing stories of hiding in closets or nearby offices fearing 
for their safety; 
Whereas essential staff, many of whom are minorities, were 
forced to confront the racist and White nationalist sym-
bols that occupied the United States Capitol; 
Whereas essential staff, often left vulnerable in hostile situa-
tions, have had little time to process the traumatic events 
that took place on January 6, 2021; 
Whereas after the attack ended, essential staff worked 
through the evening and late-night hours to clean up the 
aftermath of the destructive mob that ransacked the 
Complex who left behind broken glass, doors, and sign-
age, trash, and bigoted symbols, as well as the horrific 
and vile spreading of feces along walls; and 
Whereas essential staff continued their regular duties without 
delay through the long night while Members of Congress 
certified the results of the Presidential election: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) honors the essential staff of the United 
2
States Capitol Complex as unsung heroes;
