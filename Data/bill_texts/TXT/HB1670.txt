Ms. PRESSLEY, Ms. LEE of California, Ms. SPEIER, Ms. DEGETTE, and

Committee on Foreign Affairs 
A BILL 
To amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize 
the use of funds for comprehensive reproductive health 
care services, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Abortion is Health 
4
Care Everywhere Act of 2021’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) Abortion is a critical component of sexual 
8
and reproductive health care and should be acces-
9
sible and affordable for all people. 
10
(2) All people have the right to make their own 
11
choices about their sexual and reproductive health, 
12
and to access quality and affordable sexual and re-
13
productive health care. International agreements 
14
have recognized reproductive rights for over 25 
15
years, and the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals

reiterated the centrality of reproductive rights to 
1
gender equality. 
2
(3) Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that 
3
when people, including young women and adolescent 
4
girls, 
gender 
non-conforming 
individuals, 
and 
5
transgender men, are able to control their reproduc-
6
tive lives, there are enormous social and economic 
7
benefits—not just for the individual and their fam-
8
ily, but for entire communities. Countries that 
9
prioritize reproductive health, rights, and justice and 
10
human rights are more likely to have better overall 
11
health throughout. 
12
(4) Health system cost is reduced when abor-
13
tion is widely available and integrated with other 
14
types of health care. 
15
(5) Without access to safe abortion care, people 
16
risk their lives to end their pregnancies. At least 
17
24,100 people in low- and middle-income countries 
18
die every year from complications from unsafe abor-
19
tion. 
20
(6) Ninety-seven percent of unsafe abortions 
21
occur in developing countries in Africa, Asia, and 
22
Latin America. In low- and middle-income countries, 
23
the annual cost of post-abortion care for all who 
24
need it would be $4 billion. The majority of this cost

is attributed to treating complications from abor-
1
tions provided in unsafe conditions. 
2
(7) Restricting abortion does not reduce either 
3
the need for or number of abortions. Abortion rates 
4
are similar in countries where it is highly restricted 
5
by law and where it is broadly legal. 
6
(8) When abortions are performed in accord-
7
ance with World Health Organization (WHO) guide-
8
lines and standards, there is minimal risk of severe 
9
complications or death. 
10
(9) As part of their commitment to prevent un-
11
safe abortions and preventable deaths and ensure all 
12
people have access to comprehensive sexual and re-
13
productive health care and can exercise their right to 
14
full control over their sexuality and reproduction, de-
15
veloping countries and donor governments must 
16
work collaboratively to deploy funding, align policies, 
17
and mobilize expertise to make safe abortion services 
18
available to those seeking to terminate pregnancies. 
19
(10) United States law restricting United 
20
States foreign assistance funding from being used to 
21
provide safe abortion services has the effect of harm-
22
ing people who seek to terminate their pregnancies 
23
in several ways, including by blocking access to serv-
24
ices and erecting barriers to providers obtaining the

(11) Since section 104(f)(1) of the Foreign As-
3
sistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b(f)(1)) (com-
4
monly referred to as the ‘‘Helms amendment’’) was 
5
enacted in 1973, dozens of governments across the 
6
globe have liberalized abortion laws and policies. 
7
(12) In countries where the United States sup-
8
ports family planning and reproductive health care 
9
and in which abortion is legal on at least some 
10
grounds, support for safe abortion could avert over 
11
19 million unsafe abortions and 17,000 maternal 
12
deaths each year. 
13
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
14
The following shall be the policy of the United States 
15
Government: 
16
(1) Safe abortion is a critical component of 
17
comprehensive maternal and reproductive health 
18
care and should be included as part of foreign assist-
19
ance programs funded by the United States Govern-
20
ment. 
21
(2) Safe abortion is to be made widely available 
22
and integrated with other types of health care. 
23
(3) The United States Government should work 
24
to end unsafe abortion and promote safe abortion
