Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
issued a guidance on May 13, 2021 stating that Ameri-
cans who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 no longer 
need to wear masks indoors or outdoors in almost all sce-
narios; 
Whereas the three widely available vaccines against Covid-19 
are highly effective; 
Whereas Dr. Anthony Fauci stated on May 16 that, ‘‘It is 
very unlikely that a vaccinated person, even if there’s a 
breakthrough infection, would transmit it to someone 
else.’’; 
Whereas those who are fully vaccinated are shown not to 
carry the viral load necessary to spread the virus, and 
therefore do not pose a significant risk; 
Whereas those who have not yet received the vaccine pose no 
real threat to those who have been vaccinated; 
Whereas there may be Members of the House of Representa-
tives whose personal physician, for various reasons, may 
recommend that they do not receive the vaccine; 
Whereas those who want to continue wearing a mask or tak-
ing other forms of precaution may do so; 
Whereas Members of the House of Representatives have a re-
sponsibility to send a message to the American people 
that we can trust the safety and efficacy of the available 
Covid-19 vaccines; 
Whereas the continued House mask mandate sends the erro-
neous message that the efficacy of the vaccines cannot be 
trusted; 
Whereas the continued House mask mandate is not based on 
the best available science, is contrary to the latest CDC

guidance, and is not in line with the protocols in place 
in the United States Senate and at the White House; and 
Whereas the continued House mask mandate hinders the 
ability of the House to properly and effectively conduct 
the people’s business: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Attending Physician, in consulta-

tion with the Director for the Centers for Disease Control

and Prevention, should take timely action to provide up-

dated mask wearing guidance applicable to the Hall of the

for Members and staff who are vaccinated against Covid-
