Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or 
1
other high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’. Further, section 
2
3 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution prohibits 
3
any person who has ‘‘engaged in insurrection or rebellion 
4
against’’ the United States from ‘‘hold[ing] any office . . . 
5
under the United States’’. In his conduct while President 
6
of the United States—and in violation of his constitutional 
7
oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the 
8
United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, pro-
9
tect, and defend the Constitution of the United States,

15
On January 6, 2021, pursuant to the 12th Amend-
16
ment to the Constitution of the United States, the Vice 
17
President of the United States, the House of Representa-
18
tives, and the Senate met at the United States Capitol 
19
for a Joint Session of Congress to count the votes of the 
20
Electoral College. In the months preceding the Joint Ses-
21
sion, President Trump repeatedly issued false statements 
22
asserting that the Presidential election results were the 
23
product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted 
24
by the American people or certified by State or Federal

officials. Shortly before the Joint Session commenced, 
1
President Trump, addressed a crowd at the Ellipse in 
2
Washington, DC. There, he reiterated false claims that 
3
‘‘we won this election, and we won it by a landslide’’. He 
4
also willfully made statements that, in context, encour-
5
aged—and foreseeably resulted in—lawless action at the 
6
Capitol, such as: ‘‘if you don’t fight like hell you’re not 
7
going to have a country anymore’’. Thus incited by Presi-
8
dent Trump, members of the crowd he had addressed, in 
9
an attempt to, among other objectives, interfere with the 
10
Joint Session’s solemn constitutional duty to certify the 
11
results of the 2020 Presidential election, unlawfully 
12
breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured and killed 
13
law enforcement personnel, menaced Members of Con-
14
gress, the Vice President, and Congressional personnel, 
15
and engaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, and sedi-
16
tious acts. 
17
President Trump’s conduct on January 6, 2021, fol-
18
lowed his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct the certifi-
19
cation of the results of the 2020 Presidential election. 
20
Those prior efforts included a phone call on January 2, 
21
2021, during which President Trump urged the secretary 
22
of state of Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, to ‘‘find’’ enough 
23
votes to overturn the Georgia Presidential election results

and threatened Secretary Raffensperger if he failed to do 
1
so. 
2
In all this, President Trump gravely endangered the 
3
security of the United States and its institutions of Gov-
4
ernment. He threatened the integrity of the democratic 
5
system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, 
6
and imperiled a coequal branch of Government. He there-
7
by betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury 
8
of the people of the United States. 
9
Wherefore, Donald John Trump, by such conduct, 
10
has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national 
11
security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to re-
12
main in office, and has acted in a manner grossly incom-
13
patible with self-governance and the rule of law. Donald 
14
John Trump thus warrants impeachment and trial, re-
15
moval from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy 
16
any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United 
17
States.
