•HRES 1015 IH 
Whereas the stepped-up basis under section 1014 of the In-
ternal Revenue Code of 1986 allows recipients of inher-
ited assets such as land, equipment, or buildings to ad-
just the cost basis of the asset to reflect its fair market 
value; 
Whereas 98 percent of farms are family owned according to 
the Department of Agriculture, and 19 percent of all 
businesses are family owned according to the Small Busi-
ness Administration; 
Whereas a study conducted by the Economic Research Serv-
ice of the Department of Agriculture determined that 66 
percent of all midsized farms would see an increased tax 
liability if the stepped-up basis were eliminated; 
Whereas the stepped-up basis is a crucial component of many 
family farms and small business succession plans; and 
Whereas the elimination of the stepped-up basis would threat-
en the ability of farmers, ranchers, agribusinesses, and 
small business owners to make generational transfers of 
their operations: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the preservation of the stepped-up 
2
basis; 
3
(2) opposes any efforts to impose new taxes on 
4
family farms or small businesses; and 
5
(3) recognizes the importance of generational 
6
transfers of farm and family-owned business oper-
7
ations.
