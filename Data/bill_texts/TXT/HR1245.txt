serving as an excellent source of beta-carotene, calcium, 
potassium, dietary fiber, and vitamins A, B, C, and K, 
which can lower rates of heart disease, cancer, stroke, 
and diabetes; 
Whereas the growing interest and popularity of kimchi as a 
dish in the United States, as evidenced by an increase in 
available kimchi-related food products, restaurant menu 
items, and interest from non-Korean consumers, rep-

Whereas kimchi is celebrated in Korea, the land of its origin, 
each year through the designation of November 22 as 
‘‘Kimchi Day’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports

the designation of ‘‘Kimchi Day’’.
