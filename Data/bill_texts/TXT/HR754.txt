Whereas House and Senate Democrats have introduced nu-
merous proposals that implement a punitive fee on meth-
ane emissions from oil and gas operations that is tanta-
mount to a tax on natural gas; 
Whereas a proposed natural gas tax would increase the aver-
age United States family’s energy bill by 17 percent; 
Whereas a proposed natural gas tax would reduce the United 
States gross domestic product by $9,000,000,000 and re-
sult in 90,000 lost jobs; 
Whereas raising consumers’ energy bills would violate Presi-
dent Biden’s pledge to not raise taxes on those making 
less than $400,000 annually; 
Whereas a natural gas tax will increase the costs of thou-
sands of manufactured products, including personal pro-
tective equipment and critical medicines; 
Whereas a natural gas tax will disproportionally harm low-in-
come families; 
Whereas a natural gas tax on energy producers will nega-
tively impact United States farmers and ranchers by in-
creasing the costs of supplies needed for agricultural pro-
duction; 
Whereas a natural gas tax on United States agriculture will 
inhibit domestic food production, significantly raise costs 
for consumers, and make United States farmers less 
competitive globally; 
Whereas farm and ranch production systems play a key role 
in strengthening United States national security and food 
security; 
Whereas Europe and Asia are experiencing an energy crisis 
due to a shortage of natural gas, resulting in record-high

energy prices and further reliance on Russian natural gas 
and coal; 
Whereas handicapping United States domestic energy produc-
tion through burdensome taxes would empower foreign 
adversaries and weaken United States national security; 
Whereas a nation that can feed and power itself is inherently 
safer and more secure than one that cannot; 
Whereas energy security is national security; 
Whereas natural gas is fundamental to allowing the United 
States to lead the world in reducing greenhouse gas emis-
sions; 
Whereas the United States has established a long-term sup-
ply of natural gas to affordably and reliably power our 
economy for decades to come; 
Whereas United States natural gas exports are increasingly 
critical to establishing clean, affordable power and raising 
prosperity elsewhere around the world, and reducing 
global greenhouse gas emissions; 
Whereas, between 2005 and 2019, carbon dioxide emissions 
from the United States power sector declined by 28 per-
cent, with the generation of power from natural gas ac-
counting for more than half of such decline; 
Whereas, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, 
methane emissions from petroleum and natural gas sys-
tems declined by 31,900,000 metric tons of carbon diox-
ide equivalent from 1990 to 2017, and over the same pe-

while oil production increased by 80 percent; 
Whereas Congress should promote policies that allow for in-
creased domestic energy production while simultaneously
