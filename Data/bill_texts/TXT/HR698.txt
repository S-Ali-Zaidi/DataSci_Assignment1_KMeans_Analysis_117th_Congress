Supporting the designation of October 2, 2021, as World 
Ostomy Day and National Ostomy Awareness Day. 
Whereas an ostomy is a type of surgery that creates an open-
ing in the abdomen that allows for the removal of bodily 
waste when a person has lost the normal function of di-
gestive or urinary systems due to birth defects, colorectal 
cancer, bladder cancer, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, 
and other medical conditions; 
Whereas an ostomy is also necessary in cases of severe ab-
dominal or pelvic trauma resulting from accidents or 
from injuries sustained during military service; 
Whereas approximately 725,000 to 1,000,000 people in the 
United States have an ostomy or continent diversion, 
with approximately 100,000 new ostomy procedures per-
formed each year;

Whereas ostomy or continent diversion surgery can occur at 
any age and does not lower life expectancy; 
Whereas through the efforts of ostomy support organizations, 
people needing these surgeries are becoming more aware 
of the opportunities for education, mutual aid, advocacy, 
and support that are of such great benefit to them and 
their families; 
Whereas the aim of National Ostomy Awareness Day is to 
work toward a society where people with ostomies and in-
testinal or urinary diversions are universally accepted and 
supported socially, economically, medically, and psycho-
logically; 
Whereas October 2, 2021, marks the 10th celebration of 
World Ostomy Day which is the result of 30 years of ad-
vocacy and education domestic and abroad to increase 
public acceptance of ostomy surgery and continent diver-
sion; 
Whereas the theme of the 10th World Ostomy Day is 
‘‘Ostomates’ Rights Are Human Rights - anytime and 
anywhere!’’ recognizes that health is a human right for 
everyone, at every age, and that this underserved patient 
population has patient rights and are entitled to quality 
ostomy health care; 
Whereas public education and awareness is vital to ensure 
those who are living with an ostomy face no discrimina-

Whereas through education and awareness we can erase the 
myths, stigma, and embarrassment that are sometimes 
associated with having an ostomy; 
Whereas there is a deep commitment to the proper care and 
advancement of knowledge about bowel and urinary di-

version surgery as a result of birth defects, disease, in-
jury, and other digestive disorders; and 
Whereas to increase public acceptance of ostomy surgery and 
continent diversion surgery and to remind those who have 
had surgery in the United States that by raising aware-
ness they can help the world better understand this life- 
saving surgery and help people receive better ostomy 
care: Now, therefore, be it
