•HRES 620 IH 
Whereas given State right-to-work (RTW) laws in 27 States, 
specifically Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Geor-
gia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Caro-
lina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South 
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, 
Wisconsin, and Wyoming, are essential to safeguarding 
the political freedom of workers and growing those States 
economies; 
Whereas 
RTW 
laws 
attract 
business 
expansion 
and 
incentivize economic investment; 
Whereas a report by NERA 360 consulting for the Chamber 
of Commerce in May 2018 found that— 
(1) private sector employment grew by 27 percent in 
RTW States between 2001 and 2016, compared to 15 
percent in non-RTW States; 
(2) on average, the annual unemployment rate in 
RTW States was 0.4 percentage points lower than in 
non-RTW States, which means that if non-RTW States 
had had the same unemployment rate as RTW States in 
2017, approximately 249,000 more people would have 
been employed; 
(3) output has also grown faster in RTW States, ris-
ing by 38 percent between 2001 and 2016, compared to 
29 percent in non-RTW States; 
(4) four of the top five States with the largest 
growth in real per capita output over this period are 
RTW States; 
(5) real manufacturing output rose by over 30 per-
cent in RTW States between 2001 and 2016 compared 
with 21 percent in non-RTW States;

(6) personal income in RTW States rose 39 percent 
in RTW States between 2001 and 2016, 33 percent more 
than in non-RTW States, which rose just 26 percent; and 
(7) as of 2017, about four percent of private sector 
workers in RTW States belonged to unions, compared 
with about nine percent in non-RTW States; 
Whereas a study by the National Institute for Labor Rela-
tions Research demonstrates that RTW laws have signifi-
cant beneficial effects on a State’s standard of living, 
enjoy greater economic vitality than do States where 
union dues and ‘‘fees’’ are compulsory, enjoyed a higher 
growth in per capita income for decades, and have faster 
growth in manufacturing and nonagricultural jobs and 
capital expenditures, lower unemployment rates, and 
fewer work stoppages; 
Whereas congressional enactment of the Taft Hartley amend-
ments of 1947 to the National Labor Relations Act es-
tablished unequivocally that States have the power to 
enact RTW laws; 
Whereas these Taft Hartley State RTW provisions have been 
in force and the law of the land for 75 years; 
Whereas during this time, more than half the States, 27 in 
all, have chosen to enact RTW laws, demonstrating broad 
public support for such laws; 
Whereas the fact that nearly a fifth of all State RTW laws— 
Indiana’s, Michigan’s, Wisconsin’s, West Virginia’s, and 
Kentucky’s—were adopted since the beginning of 2012 
demonstrates that public support for RTW laws con-
tinues to strengthen; 
Whereas any action by Congress to compel membership in or 
payment of dues to unions by overriding State RTW laws

would constitute violations of the 1st, 9th, 10th, and 
14th Amendments to the Constitution; 
Whereas RTW laws protect workers by letting them choose 
where their money goes and by requiring unions to earn 
the support and trust of their employees; 
Whereas the PRO Act and provisions in the American Jobs 
Act undermine, encroach upon, weaken, and supersede 
State RTW laws that protect workers’ constitutional 
rights and grow our Nation’s economy; and 
Whereas forced unionization violates the basic freedom of in-
dividuals, forces individuals to subsidize political activities 
they disagree with, and does little more than line the 
pockets of union bosses and their political enablers: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives should 
1
not void State right-to-work laws by enacting the Pro-
2
tecting the Right to Organize Act, provisions in the Amer-
3
ican Jobs Act, or any other measure.
