(2) The tactic of using professional union orga-
1
nizers and agents to infiltrate a targeted employer’s 
2
workplace, a practice commonly referred to as ‘‘salt-
3
ing’’ has evolved into an aggressive form of harass-
4
ment not contemplated when the National Labor Re-
5
lations Act was enacted and threatens the balance of 
6
rights. 
7
(3) Increasingly, union organizers are seeking 
8
employment with nonunion employers not because of 
9
a desire to work for such employers but primarily to 
10
organize the employees of such employers or to in-
11
flict economic harm specifically designed to put non-
12
union competitors out of business, or to do both. 
13
(4) While no employer may discriminate against 
14
employees based upon the views of employees con-
15
cerning collective bargaining, an employer should 
16
have the right to expect job applicants to be pri-
17
marily interested in utilizing the skills of the appli-
18
cants to further the goals of the business of the em-
19
ployer.

22

23

24
individuals who seek or gain employment in order to
