Whereas every child has the right to an education that helps 
them reach their full potential and to attend schools that 
offer a high-quality educational experience; 
Whereas stable, equitable, predictable, and adequate funding 
for great public schools for every student in the United 
States is necessary to ensure that students have inviting 
classrooms and school libraries with up-to-date resources 
as well as well-prepared and supported educators; 
Whereas educators include teachers, paraprofessionals, and 
principals who provide a well-rounded and complete cur-
riculum and create joy in learning; 
Whereas the Nation’s school buildings should have class sizes 
small enough to allow students to receive one-on-one at-
tention and to access support services such as health 
care, nutrition, and after-school programs when needed; 
Whereas students, teachers, and professionals make the Na-
tion’s public schools vital components of the community; 
Whereas parents and communities are working hard to im-
prove educational outcomes for children across the coun-
try; and 
Whereas the week of February 21 through February 25, 
2022, would be an appropriate period to designate as 
‘‘Public Schools Week’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports 
1
the designation of ‘‘Public Schools Week’’.
