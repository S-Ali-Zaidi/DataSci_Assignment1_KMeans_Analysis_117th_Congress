Whereas in pursuit of the American dream, Korean immi-
grants initially served as farmworkers, wage laborers, and 
section hands throughout the United States;

new home in a new land through resilience, tenacious ef-
fort, and immense sacrifice, which became the bedrock 
for their children and future generations of Korean 
Americans;

milestone in the history of Korean immigration; 
Whereas the House passed House Resolution 487 to com-
memorate Korean American Day in the 109th Congress;

memorate Korean American Day in the 109th Congress;

homeland due to a strong work ethic, family bonds, and 
community spirit;

tions to the economic vitality of the United States and
