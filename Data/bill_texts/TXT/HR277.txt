in our laws of free speech and underpins the virtues on 
which we established our Constitution, ‘‘in Order to form 
a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic

general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to 
ourselves and our Posterity . . .’’; 
Whereas having independent, diverse, and local media that 
provide exposure to a broad range of viewpoints and the 
ability to contribute to the political debate is central to 
sustaining that informed engagement; 
Whereas it is in the public interest to encourage source, con-
tent, and audience diversity on our Nation’s shared tele-
communications and media platforms; 
Whereas the survival of small, independent, and diverse 
media outlets that serve diverse audiences and local 
media markets is essential to preserving local culture and 
building understanding on important community issues 
that impact the daily lives of residents; 
Whereas research by the American Society of News Editors, 
the Radio Television Digital News Association, the Pew

lations in media ownership and decision making are com-
bining to negatively impact our goal of increasing local 
civic engagement and civic knowledge through increased 
voter participation, membership in civic groups, and
