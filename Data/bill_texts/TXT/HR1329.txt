Mr. POSEY (for himself and Mr. SOTO) submitted the following resolution;

RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the need for greater access to rural and 
agricultural media programming. 
Whereas individuals living in rural areas in the United States 
need access to media content that is relevant to their 
daily lives; 
Whereas rural and agricultural programming includes agri-
cultural weather, agribusiness news, commodity market 
news, and western sports, and this programming is im-
portant to the farmers and ranchers of the United States 
for their way of life and making a living; 
Whereas rural and agricultural programming covers matters 
that affect all individuals in the United States;

•HRES 1329 IH 
Whereas all individuals in the United States need to be ex-
posed to, and informed about, what is occurring outside 
of the major cities and suburbs of the United States; 
Whereas all individuals in the United States feel the effects 
of inflation and supply chain shortages, and rural and 
agricultural programming is in a unique position to in-
form viewers of the roots of these issues; 
Whereas the population of the world is projected to grow 
from 7,000,000,000 to approximately 9,000,000,000 by 
2050, and agricultural productivity will need to increase 
to meet the growing demand for food and the projected 
increase in consumption; 
Whereas a decrease in investment in agricultural research 
and development would result in a negative shock to agri-
cultural productivity; 
Whereas an informed public is key to supporting the proper 
level of investment in agricultural research and develop-
ment; 
Whereas significant consolidation in the media market and 
prioritization of consolidated media has had a negative 
impact on access to rural and agricultural programming; 
and 
Whereas multichannel video programming distributors and 
providers of digital and streaming media should make de-
livery of rural and agricultural programming, including 
agricultural news and western lifestyle content, a priority: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
1
nizes the importance of rural and agricultural program-
