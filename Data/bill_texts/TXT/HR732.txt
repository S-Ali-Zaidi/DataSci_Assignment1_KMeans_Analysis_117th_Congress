•HRES 732 IH 
Whereas the principles contained in America’s founding docu-
ments actually served as a force for liberation and not 
tyranny; 
Whereas this idea is premised on the fact that abolitionists 
and proponents for civil rights continually cited these 
founding documents as inspiration in their struggle 
against repression; 
Whereas the society of the United States is built on the 
ideals of equality, tolerance, and acceptance; 
Whereas the National Archives and Records Administration 
recently put a ‘‘harmful content’’ warning label on the 
founding documents of the United States; 
Whereas this type of censorship showcases a frightening igno-
rance of the true history of the United States; 
Whereas Congress is proud of the founding documents and 
the freedom guaranteed to Americans within these docu-
ments; 
Whereas all Americans should be grateful for the sacrifices 
of those who gave their lives in defense of the Constitu-
tion and the spread of freedom; and 
Whereas this censorship betrays the harmful nature of pro-
gressive skepticism of American exceptionalism: Now, 
therefore, be it
