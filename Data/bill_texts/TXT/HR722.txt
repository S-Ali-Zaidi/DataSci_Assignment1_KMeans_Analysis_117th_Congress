Whereas families would benefit from bereavement leave from 
work to take care of themselves and their families; 
Whereas people who have experienced pregnancy loss or in-
fant loss should not have their experiences minimized or 
stigmatized; 
Whereas Congress should acknowledge the personal experi-
ences of individuals who have lost a pregnancy or infant 
and empower those individuals to speak about their 
losses; 
Whereas recognizing ‘‘Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remem-
brance Day’’ is an opportunity to increase awareness, 
promote research and greater understanding, and provide 
community to individuals who have experienced preg-
nancy loss or infant loss; and 
Whereas ‘‘Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day’’ 
allows the people of the United States to consider how we 
can best support families who experience, or work to pre-
vent, pregnancy or infant loss: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of ‘‘National 
2
Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day’’; 
3
(2) understands the importance of honoring 
4
these losses and supporting affected people and their 
5
families; and

7
mation calling upon the people of the United States
