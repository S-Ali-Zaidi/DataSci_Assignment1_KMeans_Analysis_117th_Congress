in the blast; 
Whereas the attack killed 220 marines, members of the 1st

Whereas October 23, 1983, was the deadliest day for the Ma-
rine Corps since the Battle of Iwo Jima in February

Whereas, in addition to the Marine Corps casualties, 18 Navy 
sailors and 3 Army soldiers were killed, and more than

killed 63 people, including 17 Americans, and injured 
120 others in front of the United States Embassy in Bei-
rut; and 
Whereas it is fitting and proper that the events of October
