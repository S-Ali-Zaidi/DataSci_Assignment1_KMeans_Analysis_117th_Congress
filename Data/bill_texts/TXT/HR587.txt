RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
Congress disapproves of Department of Defense leader-
ship pursuing adverse actions toward members of the 
Armed Forces of the United States who choose not to 
receive a COVID–19 vaccine. 
Whereas the Secretary of Defense has announced a COVID– 
19 vaccine mandate will take effect for the Armed Forces 
of the United States even if the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration has only approved the COVID–19 vaccine under 
an emergency use authorization; 
Whereas many Americans have reservations about taking a 
vaccine that has only been available for less than a year;

•HRES 587 IH 
Whereas reports of adverse actions being taken, or threat-
ened, by military leadership at all levels are antithetical 
to our fundamental American values; and 
Whereas any discharge other than honorable denotes a dere-
liction of duty or that a servicemember did not serve the 
United States and its people to the best of his or her 
ability: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives stands 
1
in opposition to any adverse punishment or any discharge 
2
that is not an honorable discharge for servicemembers 
3
whose discharge is because they choose not to receive the 
4
COVID–19 vaccine.
