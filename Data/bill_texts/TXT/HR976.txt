Achaemenid Persian Empire grand vizier who intended to 
kill all the Jews in the ancient Persian Empire; 
Whereas, in the 4th century B.C.E., Esther became the new 
queen of the empire, despite being Jewish, and her cous-
in, Mordechai, refused to follow Haman’s orders, infuri-
ating Haman; 
Whereas it states in Megillas Esther (the Book of Esther) 
that Purim means ‘‘lots’’ in ancient Persian, and the hol-
iday was named such since Haman had thrown lots to de-
termine when he would carry out his plot; 
Whereas the Jewish people celebrate Purim by reading of the 
Megillah, giving gifts to at least two poor people, sending 
gifts of two kinds of food to at least one person, and by 
taking part in a Purim feast; 
Whereas the traditional food of Purim is hamantaschen, a 
pastry with poppy seeds or sweet filling; and 
Whereas the meanings of Purim are to celebrate the Jewish 
people reaccepting the Torah with love, specifically Torah 
she’Baal Peh (verbally transmitted Jewish Law), ac-
knowledge Jewish survival despite Haman’s plot, cele-
brate God’s involvement in the world, and celebrate a re-
newed sense of spirituality among Jewish people: Now, 
therefore, be it

nity in the United States, and throughout the world;
