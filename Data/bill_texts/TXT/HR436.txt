•HRES 436 IH 
Whereas increasing intermittent sun exposure in childhood 
and during one’s lifetime is associated with an increased 
risk of squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, 
and melanoma; 
Whereas even one blistering sunburn during childhood or 
adolescence can nearly double a person’s chance of devel-
oping melanoma later in life, while five or more blistering 
sunburns in late adolescence increases one’s melanoma 
risk by 80 percent and nonmelanoma risk by 68 percent; 
Whereas because sunscreen is an over-the-counter drug, sun-
screen is not allowed in many schools without physician 
authorization; 
Whereas in these cases, sunscreen is usually required to be 
stored in a locked cabinet in the nurse’s office; 
Whereas sunscreens that meet FDA standards can be used 
safely without consulting a health care professional when 
used as directed; and 
Whereas research shows that broad spectrum sunscreen with 
SPF 30 or higher, when used as directed with other skin 
protection measures, can prevent sunburn and reduce the 
risk of skin cancer and premature aging: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports Federal, State, and local efforts to 
2
exempt sunscreen from over-the-counter medication 
3
bans in schools and encourages all schools to allow 
4
students to possess sunscreen at school without re-
5
striction and without requiring physician authoriza-
6
tion;
