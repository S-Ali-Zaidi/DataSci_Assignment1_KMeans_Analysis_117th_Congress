name ‘‘River of Grass’’ stating, ‘‘There are no other Ev-
erglades in the world’’; 
Whereas Everglades National Park has been designated an 
International Biosphere Reserve, a World Heritage Site, 
and a Wetland of International Importance, in recogni-
tion of its significance to all the people of the world; 
Whereas the Everglades ecosystem encompasses 3,000,000 
acres of wetlands and is the largest subtropical wilder-
ness in the United States featuring slow-moving fresh-
water that flows south from Lake Okeechobee through 
sawgrass and tree islands to the mangroves and 
seagrasses of Florida Bay; 
Whereas Everglades National Park is home to rare and en-
dangered species, such as the American crocodile, the 
Florida panther, and the West Indian manatee, and more 
than 350 species of birds, including the Great Egret, 
Wood Stork, Swallow-tailed Kite, and Roseate Spoonbill; 
Whereas the Central and South Florida region is an inter-
national center for business, agriculture, and tourism, 
with a rapidly growing population of varying demo-
graphics, all of which are dependent on a sustainable 
framework for the water resources of the region to re-
store the Everglades ecosystem, provide adequate fresh-
water supplies, and promote a healthy and sustainable 
economy and overall quality of life; 
Whereas the Everglades provides freshwater for 9,000,000 
Floridians and countless tourists each year; 
Whereas the Biscayne Aquifer is replenished by the flow of
