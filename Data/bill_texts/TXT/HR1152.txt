RESOLUTION 
Condemning the atrocity that occurred in Buffalo, New York, 
on May 14, 2022, in which 10 Americans were killed 
and 3 were injured, and in which 11 of the 13 victims 
were Black Americans, condemning the Great Replace-
ment Theory as a White supremacist conspiracy theory, 
and reaffirming the House of Representatives commit-
ment to combating White supremacy, hatred, and racial 
injustice. 
Whereas, on May 14, 2022, in Buffalo, New York, 10 Ameri-
cans were killed and 3 were injured by a self-described 
White supremacist who drove more than 200 miles to 
carry out this racist, violent mass shooting with an as-
sault-style rifle at a supermarket in a predominantly 
Black neighborhood; 
Whereas the self-described White supremacist and antisemite 
who allegedly carried out this racially motivated, anti- 
Black massacre with a firearm reportedly wrote a mani-
festo citing the White supremacist Great Replacement 
Theory; 
Whereas the alleged gunman livestreamed the mass shooting 
on Twitch;

Whereas the victims who tragically died were Aaron Salter, 
Ruth Whitfield, Pearly Young, Katherine ‘‘Kat’’ Massey, 
Heyward Patterson, Celestine Chaney, Roberta Drury, 
Margus D. Morrison, Andre Mackneil, and Geraldine 
Talley; 
Whereas the victims who were injured were Zaire Goodman, 
Jennifer Warrington, and Christopher Braden; 
Whereas the ‘‘Great Replacement Theory’’ is a White su-
premacist conspiracy theory that perpetuates the racist, 
xenophobic, nativist, Islamophobic, and antisemitic false-
hood that non-White immigrants are being brought into 
the United States and other Western countries to repopu-
late majority White countries and disempower White vot-
ers to achieve a political agenda, and to specifically bring 
upon the genocide of White people; 
Whereas this hateful conspiracy theory has been cited as a 
motivation for White supremacist terrorist attacks do-
mestically and internationally, including— 
(1) the targeting of a Tops Friendly Market in a 
predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, 
in 2022, in which the alleged gunman murdered 10 Black 
people, and injured 1 Black person and 2 White people; 
(2) the murder of 9 Black worshipers at the Eman-
uel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, 
South Carolina, in 2015; 
(3) the White nationalist Unite the Right rally in 
Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 that resulted in 9 
wounded and in the murder of Heather Heyer; 
(4) the murder of 11 people and wounding of 6 in 
an antisemitic attack on the Tree of Life L’Simcha syna-
gogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 2018;

(5) the targeting of Muslim worshippers, in which a 
gunman murdered 50 people at the Al Noor Mosque and 
Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 
2019; 
(6) the targeting of a Walmart in a predominantly 
Hispanic neighborhood in El Paso, Texas, in 2019, in 
which a gunman murdered 23 people and injured 3; and 
(7) the targeting of 3 Asian-owned spas in the At-
lanta, Georgia, metro area on March 16, 2021, in which 
a gunman killed 8 people, including 6 Asian women; 
Whereas this hateful conspiracy theory and White supremacy 
inflicts harm to individuals and communities in addition 
to physical injuries and death; 
Whereas many individuals in positions of power and media 
institutions with widely viewed public platforms have con-
tributed to the normalization and legitimization of the 
underlying principles of the Great Replacement Theory; 
and 
Whereas the people of the United States stand in solidarity 
with those harmed by this hateful, senseless tragedy: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) condemns in the strongest terms the Great 
2
Replacement Theory, a White supremacist con-
3
spiracy theory that has been used to falsely justify 
4
racially motivated, violent acts of terrorism domesti-
5
cally and internationally;

(2) honors the memory and legacy of the vic-
