Whereas al-Qaida was based in the country of Afghanistan, 
which was governed by the ruthless and oppressive 
Taliban regime; 
Whereas the United States led an international coalition of 
military forces into Afghanistan to destroy al-Qaida, kill 
or capture Osama Bin Laden, and depose the Taliban 
government; 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of United States members of 
the Armed Forces, diplomats, and humanitarians de-
ployed to Afghanistan or supported operations from afar; 
Whereas for nearly 2 decades, the United States was spared 
from further major attacks by international terror orga-
nizations; and 
Whereas the withdrawal of the presence of the United States 
in Afghanistan had led to the collapse of the Afghan gov-
ernment, return of the Taliban to Afghan rule, and great 
heartache for so many: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) the men and women who undertook the ef-
3
forts of the past years in Afghanistan provided he-
4
roic service to the country; 
5
(2) the peace our country experienced is a di-
6
rect result of the actions of our brave members of 
7
the Armed Forces, diplomats, and humanitarians; 
8
(3) despite the chaotic end to operations in Af-
9
ghanistan, their service is something to be remem-
10
bered, lauded, and honored; and
