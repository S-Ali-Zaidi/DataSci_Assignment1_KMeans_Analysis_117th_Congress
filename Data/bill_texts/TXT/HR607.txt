Affairs 
RESOLUTION 
Condemns President Biden’s failure to heed the advice of 
military and intelligence advisors about the speed and 
nature of the Taliban offensive, leading to a disorga-
nized, chaotic, and abrupt evacuation of United States 
personnel and Afghan allies. 
Whereas despite increasing Taliban violence in the first three 
months of 2021 and intelligence that the Taliban and al- 
Qaida were maintaining close ties, on April 14, 2021, 
President Biden announced a full United States troop 
withdrawal from Afghanistan by September 11, 2021; 
Whereas in his April 14, 2021, announcement of full United 
States troop withdrawal, President Biden stated, ‘‘We 
will not conduct a hasty rush to the exit’’ and ‘‘We’ll do 
it responsibly, deliberately, and safely’’, and flatly denied 
the assessments from his own intelligence community 
about prospects for the fall of the government in Kabul; 
Whereas, on July 6, 2021, the United States military with-
drew from Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan, reportedly 
without notifying the base’s new Afghan commander; 
Whereas, on July 8, 2021, President Biden said that ‘‘there’s 
going to be no circumstance where you see people being 
lifted off the roof of an embassy of the United States 
from Afghanistan’’, adding ‘‘the likelihood there’s going

to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the 
whole country is highly unlikely’’ and moved up the Sep-
tember 11, 2021, withdrawal date to another arbitrary 
date of August 31, 2021; 
Whereas, on July 12, 2021, President Biden ordered 4-star 
General Austin Miller, Commander of NATO’s Resolute 
Support Mission and United States Forces-Afghanistan, 
to relinquish his position and depart Afghanistan, leaving 
the remaining United States presence without a seasoned 
leader in the face of a growing Taliban offensive; 
Whereas, on August 6, 2021, the first Provincial capital, 
Zaranj, fell to the Taliban since the signing of the United 
States-Taliban agreement, leading to a violent onslaught 
of offensives throughout other Provinces; 
Whereas, on August 15, 2021, the United States Embassy in 
Kabul was evacuated and Taliban fighters soon stood 
outside chanting ‘‘Death to America’’; 
Whereas, as of August 23, 2021, the Department of State 
and Department of Defense were unable to provide the 
number of United States citizens and lawful permanent 
residents (LPRs) remaining in Afghanistan, including the 
status of Mark Frerichs who is held hostage, an estimate 
of how long it will take to evacuate this number of citi-
zens and LPRs, and what efforts are being made to se-
cure their return to the United States; and 
Whereas the Biden administration received countless letters, 
calls, and oversight questions from bipartisan Members of 
Congress over the last 7 months on plans for the with-
drawal that received minimal response: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
