Expressing support for the designation of December 3, 2021, as the ‘‘National 
Day of 3D Printing’’. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
DECEMBER 3, 2021 
Mr. FOSTER (for himself, Mr. TAKANO, Ms. STEVENS, Mr. RYAN, and Ms. 
ROSS) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce 
RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of December 3, 2021, 
as the ‘‘National Day of 3D Printing’’. 
Whereas additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, 
is a process by which digital 3D design data is used to 
build up a component in layers by depositing material; 
Whereas 3D printing creates an object layer by layer, greatly 
reducing waste and increasing efficiency compared to tra-
ditional manufacturing techniques; 
Whereas 3D printing has grown exponentially over the last 
several years; 
Whereas the United States is a world leader in advanced 
manufacturing, and has a history of design innovation;

Whereas public-private partnerships that promote advanced 
manufacturing, such as America Makes, Manufacturing x 
Digital, and other Manufacturing USA institutes, will de-
velop enhanced digital capabilities to design and test new 
products and reduce costs in manufacturing processes 
across a variety of industries; 
Whereas 3D printing has widespread applications in home 
construction, home goods production, biotechnology, the 
automotive sector, aerospace, medicine, consumer elec-
tronics, and defense; 
Whereas 3D printing has the potential to reshape manufac-
turing in the United States, by decreasing the cost of 
producing goods for small businesses and local manufac-
turers; 
Whereas innovation will be increased, as 3D printing reduces 
the time required for product development and market 
launch; and 
Whereas December 3, 2021, would be an appropriate date to 
designate as the ‘‘National Day of 3D Printing’’: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of the ‘‘National 
2
Day of 3D Printing’’; 
3
(2) recognizes the economic impact of 3D print-
4
ing and the positive implications of 3D printing for 
5
the United States advanced manufacturing sector;
