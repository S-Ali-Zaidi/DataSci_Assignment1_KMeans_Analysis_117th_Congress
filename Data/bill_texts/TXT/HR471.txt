(PCOS) and expressing support for the designation of 
the month of September 2021 as ‘‘PCOS Awareness 
Month’’. 
Whereas polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common 
health problem among women and girls involving a hor-
monal imbalance; 
Whereas there is no universal definition of PCOS, but re-
searchers estimate that 5 to 10 million women in the 
United States are affected by the condition, and preva-
lence estimates range from 8 to 13 percent of women 
globally; 
Whereas the most recent published data, a 2004 study, esti-
mates the annual burden of PCOS in the United States 
is $4.36 billion, and this figure pertains to women’s re-
productive years alone and does not consider the cost of 
other comorbidities, including obstetrical complications or 
the cost of metabolic morbidities in post-menopause or 
adolescence; 
Whereas PCOS can affect girls from the onset of puberty and 
throughout the remainder of their lives; 
Whereas the symptoms of PCOS include infertility, irregular 
or absent menstrual periods, acne, weight gain, thinning 
of scalp hair, excessive facial and body hair growth, nu-
merous small ovarian cysts, pelvic pain, and mental 
health problems; 
Whereas women with PCOS have higher rates of psychosocial 
disorders, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, 
and eating disorders, and are at greater risk for suicide; 
Whereas adolescents with PCOS often are not diagnosed, 
many of whom have metabolic dysfunction and insulin re-
sistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes, cardio-

vascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic 
fatty liver disease, and endometrial cancer at a young 
adult age; 
Whereas PCOS is the most common cause of female infer-
tility; 
Whereas PCOS in pregnancy is associated with increased risk 
of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced 
hypertension, preterm delivery, cesarean delivery, mis-
carriage, and fetal and infant death; 
Whereas women with PCOS are at increased risk of devel-
oping high blood pressure, high cholesterol, stroke, and 
heart disease (the leading cause of death among women); 
Whereas women with PCOS have a more than 50 percent 
chance of developing type 2 diabetes or prediabetes be-
fore the age of 40; 
Whereas women with PCOS may be at a higher risk for 
breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and have a 3 times 
higher risk for developing endometrial cancer compared 
to women who do not have PCOS; 
Whereas research has found genetic evidence of a causal link 
to depression in PCOS; 
Whereas research has found genetic correlations with obesity, 
fasting insulin, type 2 diabetes, lipid levels, and coronary 
artery disease, indicating shared genetic architecture be-
tween metabolic traits and PCOS; 
Whereas adolescents with PCOS are at markedly increased 
risk for type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and heart dis-
ease; 
Whereas PCOS negatively alters metabolic function inde-
pendent of, but exacerbated by, increased BMI;

Whereas an estimated 50 percent of women with PCOS are 
undiagnosed, and many remain undiagnosed until they 
experience fertility difficulties or develop type 2 diabetes 
or other cardiometabolic disorders; 
Whereas the cause of PCOS is unknown, but researchers 
have found strong links to a genetic predisposition, and 
significant insulin resistance, which affects up to 70 per-
cent of women with PCOS; and 
Whereas there is no known cure for PCOS: Now, therefore, 
be it
