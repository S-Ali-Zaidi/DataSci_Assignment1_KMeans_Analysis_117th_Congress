H. RES. 856 
Expressing support for the designation of ‘‘National Amplified Musculoskeletal 
Pain Syndrome Awareness Day’’. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
DECEMBER 14, 2021 
Ms. WILD (for herself and Mr. FITZPATRICK) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce 
RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of ‘‘National 
Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndrome Awareness Day’’. 
Whereas amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome (in this 
preamble referred to as ‘‘AMPS’’) is a medical condition 
that causes individuals to experience an abnormal pain 
reflex that causes constriction of blood vessels, bones, and 
skin, which deprives muscles of appropriate oxygenation 
and results in acid buildup; 
Whereas AMPS amplifies a mild pain signal into an ex-
tremely painful signal; 
Whereas the 3 main causes of AMPS are psychological stress, 
injury, and illness; 
Whereas there are numerous types of AMPS, including com-
plex regional pain syndrome, fibromyalgia, myofascial

pain syndrome, neuropathic pain, psychogenic pain, and 
reflex neurovascular dystrophy; 
Whereas amplified pain in children is not well studied but is 
known to include localized pain and diffuse pain and is 
estimated to affect 2 percent to 6 percent of children; 
Whereas 6 to 12 percent of children have fibromyalgia and 
87 percent of children that meet fibromyalgia criteria are 
female; 
Whereas 80 percent of children with AMPS are preadolescent 
or adolescent girls and the typical patient is a teenage 
girl with a pain rating of ‘‘10 out of 10’’; 
Whereas symptoms can occur acutely or take weeks to de-
velop and may include pain in one or multiple limbs, pain 
throughout the whole body or in the abdomen, headaches, 
skin temperature changes, skin color changes, swelling of 
the affected extremity, vascular changes, conversions, and 
allodynia; 
Whereas AMPS is difficult to diagnose and patients often see 
multiple specialists and are prescribed a variety of unsuc-
cessful medications, procedures, and surgeries to treat 
their pain, which perpetuates the symptoms of AMPS 
and burdens families with additional health care costs; 
Whereas pediatric amplified pain is being diagnosed with 
greater frequency but has no known cure; 
Whereas once diagnosed, treatment and therapy focused on 
aerobic exercise, physical and occupational therapy, stress 
management, and counseling have proven to be more ef-
fective than the administration of pain management 
medications and more invasive procedures;

Whereas the treatment goal is to restore function and return 
a child to the child’s prior functional level at school, in 
sports, and in leisure activities; and 
Whereas when patients are in treatment focused on aerobic 
exercise, physical and occupational therapy, and stress 
management and counseling, patients see a significant re-
duction in their pain according to published studies: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes amplified musculoskeletal pain 
2
syndrome (‘‘AMPS’’) and the effects it has on those 
3
who are afflicted, particularly the minor population; 
4
and 
5
(2) supports the designation of ‘‘National Am-
