the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce 
RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of Journeyman 
Lineworkers Recognition Day. 
Whereas journeyman lineworkers provide a vital service on a 
daily basis; 
Whereas journeyman lineworkers put their lives on the line 
every day to assure safe and reliable power for the Amer-
ican people; 
Whereas journeyman lineworkers work at heights and in close 
proximity to energized electric lines; 
Whereas journeyman lineworkers continue to provide valuable 
and heroic services during major national and regional 
disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, and 
pandemics, along with working extremely long hours 
under dangerous conditions to restore power; 
Whereas Henry Miller, the first elected president of the 
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was 
killed on July 10, 1896, at just 38 years old; 
Whereas Henry Miller died of injuries sustained while trou-
bleshooting an electrical outage; and 
Whereas there should be a day to honor those industry first 
responders who have given their lives in the line of duty 
along with those who provide skillful service in times of 
local or national crisis: Now, therefore, be it
