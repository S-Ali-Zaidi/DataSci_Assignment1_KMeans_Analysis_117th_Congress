resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Education and Labor 
RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the recognition of October 2021 as 
‘‘National Dyslexia Awareness Month’’. 
Whereas dyslexia is— 
(1) defined as an unexpected difficulty in reading for 
an individual who has the intelligence to be a much bet-
ter reader; and 
(2) most commonly caused by a difficulty in phono-
logical processing (the appreciation of the individual 
sounds of spoken language), which affects the ability of 
an individual to speak, read, and spell; 
Whereas the First Step Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–391; 
132 Stat. 5194) included a definition of dyslexia as part

of the requirement of the Act to screen inmates for dys-
lexia upon intake in Federal prisons; 
Whereas the definition of dyslexia in section 3635 of title 18, 
United States Code, as added by section 101(a) of the 
First Step Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–391; 132 Stat. 
5195), is the first and only definition of dyslexia in a 
Federal statute; 
Whereas dyslexia is the most common learning disability and 
affects 80 to 90 percent of all individuals with a learning 
disability; 
Whereas dyslexia is persistent and highly prevalent, affecting 
as many as 1 out of every 5 individuals; 
Whereas dyslexia is a paradox, in that an individual with dys-
lexia may have both— 
(1) weaknesses in decoding that result in difficulties 
in accurate or fluent word recognition; and 
(2) strengths in higher level cognitive functions, 
such as reasoning, critical thinking, concept formation, 
and problem solving; 
Whereas great progress has been made in understanding dys-
lexia on a scientific level, including the epidemiology and 
cognitive and neurobiological bases of dyslexia; 
Whereas the achievement gap between typical readers and 
dyslexic readers occurs as early as first grade; 
Whereas early screening for, and early diagnosis of, dyslexia 
are critical for ensuring that individuals with dyslexia re-
ceive focused, evidence-based intervention that leads to 
fluent reading, the promotion of self-awareness and self- 
empowerment, and the provision of necessary accom-
modations that ensure success in school and in life; and
