Whereas, according to studies, 3,400,000 Americans aged 40 
years or older are blind or visually impaired, and a total 
of 80,000,000 Americans have potentially blinding eye 
diseases; 
Whereas, according to studies, people with vision loss are 
more likely to report depression, diabetes, hearing impair-
ment, stroke, falls, cognitive decline, and premature 
death, and decreased ability to see often leads to inability 
to drive, read, and keep accounts;

Whereas among people aged 65 and older, 54.2 percent of 
those who are blind and 41.7 percent of those with im-
paired vision say their overall health is poor; 
Whereas school-aged children with vision impairment can also 
experience lower levels of educational achievement; 
Whereas adults with vision impairment often have lower lev-
els of workforce participation and productivity and higher 
rates of depression and anxiety; 
Whereas women make up roughly two-thirds of all people 
with blindness and vision problems; 
Whereas, according to studies, African and Latino Americans 
have an even higher risk than others of developing dia-
betic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataracts; 
Whereas, according to studies, the cost of vision loss is esti-
mated to exceed $35,000,000,000; and 
Whereas vision impairment poses an enormous financial bur-
den, with productivity losses associated with vision im-
pairment from uncorrected myopia and presbyopia alone 
estimated to cost the United States $244,000,000,000 
and $25,400,000,000, respectively, annually: Now, there-
fore, be it
