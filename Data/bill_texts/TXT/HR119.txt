1ST SESSION 
H. RES. 119 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States 
Postal Service should take all appropriate measures to restore service 
standards in effect as of July 1, 2012. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
FEBRUARY 11, 2021 
Mr. MCKINLEY (for himself, Ms. KAPTUR, Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania, Mr. 
TONKO, Mr. YOUNG, Mr. RYAN, Mr. FITZPATRICK, and Mr. ALLRED) 
submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee 
on Oversight and Reform 
RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States Postal Service should take all appro-
priate measures to restore service standards in effect 
as of July 1, 2012. 
Whereas, on January 5, 2015, the United States Postal Serv-
ice has implemented lower ‘‘service standards’’ to vir-
tually eliminate overnight delivery of first class mail and 
periodicals, and further delay most other mail; 
Whereas the Postal Regulatory Commission found that it was 
not necessary to degrade postal services to realize sub-
stantial cost savings and that there are other ways to 
save the postal service money without jeopardizing the 
service Americans rely upon;

•HRES 119 IH 
Whereas delayed mail negatively impacts businesses, hurts 
residents, rural communities, and the economy, and 
drives customers away, resulting in lower revenue and 
worsens the Postal Service’s financial situation; and 
Whereas robust service standards implemented by the United 
States Postal Service are essential to providing prompt 
and timely delivery of all mail, online purchases, local 
newspapers, newsletters, bill payments, letters, invita-
tions, packages, and medicines: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that the United States Postal Service should 
2
take all appropriate measures to restore service standards 
3
in effect as of July 1, 2012.
