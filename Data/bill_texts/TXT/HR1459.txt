Nations Command to defend freedom and democracy in 
the Korean Peninsula; 
Whereas the United States suffered 36,574 dead and 
103,284 wounded during the Korean War in some of the 
most horrific conditions in the history of warfare; 
Whereas nearly 70 years have passed since the signing of the 
cease-fire agreement at Panmunjom on July 27, 1953, 
and the Korean Peninsula still technically remains in a 
state of war; 
Whereas, known as ‘‘Korean Defense Veterans’’, nearly 
25,000 United States soldiers, sailors, airmen, and ma-
rines remain stationed in South Korea to continue pro-
tecting democracy, and hundreds of these brave 
servicemembers have tragically perished in their efforts to 
preserve the armistice; 
Whereas the Korean War has become a ‘‘Forgotten War’’ for 
many Americans; 
Whereas many members of the Armed Forces who fought in 
the Korean War returned home without the fanfare that 
greeted the heroes of World Wars I and II; 
Whereas veterans of the Korean War and Korean Defense 
Veterans deserve to be recognized by all Americans for 
their honorable service during and after the Korean War 
in defense of democracy and freedom; and 
Whereas the people of the United States and the Republic of 
Korea are eternally grateful to the veterans of the Ko-
rean War and Korean Defense Veterans: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
1
nizes the importance of the contributions and sacrifices
