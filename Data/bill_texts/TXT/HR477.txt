COSTA, Mr. VARGAS, and Mr. DESAULNIER) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the Committee on Natural Resources 
RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the significance of the California Waterfowl 
Association on its 75th anniversary. 
Whereas the California Waterfowl Association is celebrating 
its 75th anniversary and it is appropriate at this time to 
highlight its many achievements and underscore the posi-
tive impact it has made on the State of California; 
Whereas the California Waterfowl Association was formed in 
1945 by duck hunters concerned about the growing need 
for waterfowl conservation efforts in California; 
Whereas, at the time, California had lost approximately 90 
percent of its original wetlands, yet relatively few public 
or private resources were being invested to address this 
impact and there was also no collective voice advocating

specifically on behalf of California’s waterfowl and wet-
land resources; 
Whereas, today, the California Waterfowl Association is the 
largest State-based waterfowl group in the United States, 
with about 21,000 members; 
Whereas the California Waterfowl Association’s vision is a 
California with thriving waterfowl populations, vibrant 
wetland ecosystems, and respected hunting communities; 
Whereas its approach to conservation is to rely on science 
and work cooperatively with private landowners, State 
and Federal resource agencies, and other partners in 
order to achieve ecological benefits for both wildlife and 
people; 
Whereas, in the last three decades, the California Waterfowl 
Association has completed more than 1,400 individual 
projects to protect, restore, and enhance almost 700,000 
acres of wetlands and other waterfowl habitat, benefiting 
both game and nongame species; 
Whereas, recognizing the critical role that agriculture plays 
in California, the association works to promote wildlife- 
friendly farming practices, including a new delayed wheat 
harvest incentive program that gives ground-nesting birds 
the chance to hatch their broods and leave the field be-
fore harvest; 
Whereas the California Waterfowl Association’s Wood Duck 
Program has hatched more than 890,000 ducklings, 
while its banding program has marked over 270,000 wa-
terfowl, and has begun fitting ducks and geese with GPS 
transmitters to support cutting-edge research; 
Whereas its education programs have reached almost 320,000 
children, young adults, and families to help to create a

better understanding of biology, conservation, and the 
outdoors; 
Whereas its hunting education programs help train adults 
and children alike to become responsible hunter-conserva-
tionists, and nurture their pursuits in the field and 
marsh in hopes they will develop a lasting passion for the 
outdoors that will be passed to the next generation; 
Whereas its legislative and regulatory work occurs at both the 
State and Federal levels, and has helped to protect wet-
lands from development, secure funding for wetland and 
waterfowl management purposes, enhance enforcement of 
fish and game laws, and expand waterfowl hunting and 
other outdoor opportunities for the public, amongst oth-
ers; and 
Whereas the California Waterfowl Association currently owns 
wetland properties in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, 
Suisun Marsh, Butte Sink, and Tulare Basin, and these 
properties are not only managed to maximize wildlife 
habitat values, but are also open to public use and edu-
cation: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
1
nizes the significance of the California Waterfowl Associa-
2
tion on its 75th anniversary, and the benefits of its work 
3
for California’s waterfowl populations, wetlands, and pub-

lic enjoyment thereof.
