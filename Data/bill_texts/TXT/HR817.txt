Whereas the Children’s Bureau, an office of the Administra-
tion for Children and Families within the Department of 
Health and Human Services, supports programs, re-
search, and monitoring to help eliminate barriers to 
adoption and find permanent families for children; 
Whereas, every day, loving and nurturing families are 
strengthened and expanded when committed and dedi-
cated individuals make an important difference in the life 
of a child through adoption; 
Whereas the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic 
has presented unprecedented challenges to the United 
States; the foster care system, including kinship care; 
prospective adoptive parents; and the children awaiting 
permanency; 
Whereas foster care systems, prospective adoptive parents, 
and the children awaiting permanency have stepped up in 
brave and inspiring ways in order to meet these chal-
lenges; 
Whereas the President traditionally issues an annual procla-
mation to declare the month of November to be National 
Adoption Month, and the President has proclaimed No-
vember 2021 to be National Adoption Month; 
Whereas National Adoption Day has been celebrated as a col-
lective national effort to find permanent and loving fami-
lies for children in the foster care system; and 
Whereas the Saturday before Thanksgiving has been recog-
nized as National Adoption Day since at least 2000, and 
in 2021, the Saturday before Thanksgiving is November 
20: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
