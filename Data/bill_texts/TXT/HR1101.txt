Whereas it is in the national security interests of the United 
States to maintain a strong domestic energy supply; 
Whereas the timely delivery of affordable energy domestically 
and internationally requires an advanced and robust do-
mestic energy supply chain; 
Whereas energy workers and businesses require clear and 
supportive Federal policy to adequately maintain and de-
velop the domestic energy supply chain to meet growing 
energy needs; 
Whereas the Biden administration has taken steps, through 
executive action as well as in rhetoric, to limit American 
drillers’ ability to develop the strategic oil and natural 
gas resources of the United States; 
Whereas all the $900,000,000 deposited annually into the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund is derived from Fed-
eral oil and gas leasing; 
Whereas, as of April 29, 2022, crude oil in the Strategic Pe-
troleum Reserve fell to 550,000,000 barrels, which is the 
lowest level since August 2002; 
Whereas recent technological advances in energy resource ex-
ploration, drilling, completion, and production have led to 
unprecedented levels of efficiency and emissions reduc-
tions; 
Whereas each oil and natural gas drilling rig in the United 
States can facilitate the production of over 1,000,000 
barrels 
of 
oil 
and 
between 
5,000,000,000 
and 
10,000,000,000 cubic feet of natural gas in the first year 
from the wells it drills over a 12-month period; 
Whereas increased production and use of American natural 
gas have helped the United States reduce its greenhouse 
gas emissions by 22 percent from 2005 levels; and

in its workforce: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

through rhetoric and policy, the responsible development 
3
of hydrocarbons via drilling, including by—

(1) repealing administrative precedent that lim-
5
its the exploration, drilling, and production of do-
6
mestic natural resources on Federal lands, both on-

shore and offshore;

(2) clearly defining to the public the relation-
9
ship drilling has to future production and delivery of 
10
energy resources; and

(3) incentivizing workforce development in the 
12
United States’s domestic energy industry.
