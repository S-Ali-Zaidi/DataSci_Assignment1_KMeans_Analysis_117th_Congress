Whereas after witnessing years of environmental neglect, mil-
lions of Americans of all ages, walks of life, and political 
affiliations gathered in cities across the Nation on the 
first Earth Day to demand basic protections for our plan-
et and to commit to leaving behind a healthier world for 
the next generation; 
Whereas Earth Day united people who had been fighting 
against oil spills, polluting factories and power plants, 
raw sewage and toxic dumps, the loss of wildlife, and 
other environmental ills; 
Whereas that work continues today; 
Whereas Earth Day is an annual event created to promote 
environmental citizenship and action year-round; 
Whereas the first celebration of Earth Day was the largest 
environmental grassroots event ever held at that time and 
is widely credited with launching the modern environ-
mental movement; 
Whereas the voices of inaugural Earth Day participants gal-
vanized an unparalleled period of legislative and grass-
roots activity that changed the way we interact with the 
environment, leading to the creation of the Environ-
mental Protection Agency and passage of legislation such 
as the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the En-
dangered Species Act; 
Whereas, by 1990, Earth Day was celebrated globally, with 
200,000,000 people in 141 countries participating in 
Earth Day events; 
Whereas Earth Day encourages environmental activism and 
stewardship around the world, and reminds people to find 
ways to protect the environment, including managing 
their own environmental impact;

Whereas Earth Day serves as an opportunity to learn from 
and build community with indigenous communities, who 
have stewarded the land for generations and have great 
wisdom on preserving biodiversity; 
Whereas on Earth Day people engage in projects, initiatives, 
and campaigns to protect and restore the planet includ-
ing planting trees, removing litter, cleaning up coral 
reefs, conserving water and energy, and other environ-
mentally responsible actions; 
Whereas in recognition of the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, 
Earth Challenge 2020 was launched, a global citizen 
science initiative to demonstrate how small acts of science 
can add up to global change; 
Whereas new and continuing challenges, including climate 
change, pollution, and loss of forest, wetlands, and other 
wildlife habitats, reinforce the need for adequate protec-
tions for the air we breathe, the water we drink, the land 
we inhabit, and the animals we live alongside; 
Whereas there is scientific consensus that climate change 
poses a dire threat to our planet and its inhabitants, and 
that urgent and unprecedented changes are needed to 
mitigate its worst effects; 
Whereas Earth Day reaffirms our national responsibility in 
the global effort to combat climate change and protect 
our planet for all; 
Whereas Earth Day encourages us to acknowledge the preva-
lence of environmental injustices that directly affect the 
health and well-being of individuals and communities 
across the country, and affirms our commitment to ame-
liorating existing environmental injustices, and to pre-
venting future injustices;

Whereas Earth Day reminds us of the need to expand envi-
ronmental and climate literacy not only to strengthen en-
vironmental and climate protections but also to accelerate 
development of green technologies and creation of green 
jobs that will benefit all; 
Whereas the mission and purpose of Earth Day remains rel-
evant today because pollution, environmental degradation, 
and the climate crisis are transgenerational justice issues; 
and 
Whereas Earth Day reminds us that we must not pass a 
world beyond repair to our children: Now, therefore, be 
it
