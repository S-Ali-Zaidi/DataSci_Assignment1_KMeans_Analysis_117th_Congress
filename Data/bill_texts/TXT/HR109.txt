RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States Postal Service should take all appro-
priate measures to ensure the continuation of door deliv-
ery for all business and residential customers. 
Whereas the United States Postal Service has announced 
that it may need to eliminate or reduce levels of door-to- 
door delivery service by the conversion of millions of 
homes and businesses to centralized delivery or curbside

and require those who wish to retain their door service 
to pay a delivery tax; 
Whereas reduced levels of service will have an immediate im-
pact on current year revenue and a long-term impact on 
the viability of a business inevitably causing a larger drop 
in revenue from service cuts than from the estimated sav-
ings of elimination or reducing door delivery; 
Whereas door delivery is a vital service that the American 
people have relied on since the 1860s in both rural and 
urban areas and ensures the security of mail and pack-
ages; 
Whereas voluntary conversion of businesses in 2013 equated 
to a mere 0.8 percent of voluntary conversions confirming 
that businesses depend on in-person contact with letter 
carriers to ensure transactional security and initiate new 
business and revenue for the Postal Service; 
Whereas millions of Americans will be forced to retrieve their 
daily mail and packages from a centralized location re-
moving the daily convenience for Americans in receiving 
checks, medications and other essential items; and 
Whereas eliminating or reducing door delivery services will 
serve as a hindrance for the elderly and disabled who will 
be forced to retrieve their mail and packages and be re-
quired to submit to a cumbersome application process in 
order to opt out of the requirement: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

resentatives that the United States Postal Service should
