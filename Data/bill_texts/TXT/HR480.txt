areas of the United States, and in particular the South-

Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, which was issued 
on January 1, 1863, and months after the conclusion of

Whereas, on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers led by Major 
General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas,

former slaves remains an example for all people of the
