SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In 1991, Ukraine declared independence 
3
from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, key to 
4
the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Soon after, 
5
Ukraine disposed of the world’s third largest nuclear 
6
arsenal. 
7
(2) In April 2014, the Russian Federation an-
8
nexed Crimea and invaded the Donetsk and 
9
Luhansk regions of Eastern Ukraine; this initial 
10
conflict claimed approximately 14,000 lives. 
11
(3) On February 24, 2022, the Russian Federa-
12
tion expanded its war against Ukraine, launching a 
13
further unprovoked full-scale invasion of the peace-
14
ful, independent country. 
15
(4) In response to this unprovoked invasion, 
16
hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have heroically 
17
volunteered to defend their country, joining its 
18
Armed Forces and taking up arms against Russian 
19
Armed Forces. 
20
(5) Russia’s unjustifiable invasion has claimed 
21
thousands of innocent lives, including children and 
22
the elderly, through the targeting of civilians and the 
23
destruction of civilian infrastructure including apart-
24
ment buildings, schools, kindergartens, hotels, and 
25
hospitals.

(6) Millions of Ukrainians have been forced to 
1
leave their homes and country behind. 
2
(7) Ukrainian civilians, the Armed Forces of 
3
Ukraine, the democratic government, and its elected 
4
and civilian officials have been effective in disrupting 
5
the Russian invasion, blocking the enemy using a 
6
wide range of methods including direct combat, dis-
7
mantling nearby road signs, using cranes to move 
8
cement blocks in the way, producing improvised pet-
9
rol bombs, and setting up sandbags to block road-
10
ways. 
11
(8) Ukrainian civilians, both armed and un-
12
armed, have shown immense bravery in their heroic 
13
attempts to disrupt the Russian war efforts, with lit-
14
tle regard for their own safety. 
15
(9) The courage and strength of Ukrainian citi-
16
zens resisting their autocratic invaders has strength-
17
ened the resolve of the United States and their al-
18
lies, increasing support for the provision of military 
19
and humanitarian aid.
