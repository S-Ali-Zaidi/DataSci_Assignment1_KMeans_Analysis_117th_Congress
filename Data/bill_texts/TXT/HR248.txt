found that routine cleaning and disinfection reduce the 
number of surfaces contaminated by viruses by 62 per-

produce and deliver critical cleaning and hygiene prod-
ucts throughout the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas essential frontline cleaning professionals have 
worked tirelessly to combat the spread of COVID–19 
since the onset of this pandemic; and 
Whereas the cleaning industry has been essential in respond-
ing to those who need effective and deep cleaning to com-
bat the spread of COVID–19 and equipment to help 
them transition to virtual workspaces: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
