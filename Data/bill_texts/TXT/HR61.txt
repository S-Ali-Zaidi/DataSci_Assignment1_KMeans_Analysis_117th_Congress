Whereas a promise has been made by the Federal Govern-
ment to provide Medicare services and Social Security 
benefits for senior citizens;

scheduled to deplete by 2024, according to the non-
partisan Congressional Budget Office; 
Whereas in the absence of meaningful reform, Social Security 
is scheduled to deplete by 2034, according to the non-
partisan Social Security Administration; 
Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services esti-
mates that $42.9 billion was lost in fiscal year 2020 due 
to improper payments, including waste, fraud, and abuse, 
in the Medicare Program; and 
Whereas the Social Security Administration estimates that 
$7.8 billion was lost in fiscal year 2019 due to improper 
payments, including waste, fraud, and abuse, in the So-
cial Security program: Now, therefore, be it
