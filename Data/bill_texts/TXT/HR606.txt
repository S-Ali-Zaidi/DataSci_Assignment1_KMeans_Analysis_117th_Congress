Service System. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
AUGUST 24, 2021 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois (for herself, Mr. GOOD of Virginia, Mrs. BOEBERT, 
Mr. NORMAN, Mr. BABIN, Mr. ROY, Mrs. GREENE of Georgia, and Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
the Committee on Armed Services 
RESOLUTION 
Opposing legislation mandating the registration of women 
for the Selective Service System. 
Whereas clause 12 of section 8 of article I of the Constitution 
of the United States empowers Congress with the respon-
sibility to ‘‘raise and support Armies’’; 
Whereas the Military Selective Service Act (50 U.S.C. 3801 
et seq.) provides authority to the President to require the 
registration of male citizens of the United States, be-
tween the ages of 18 and 26, for the Selective Service 
System; 
Whereas, when a draft for training and service in the Armed 
Forces has commenced under the Military Selective Serv-

ice Act, the primary function for drafted men is to re-
place front line combatants after casualty losses; 
Whereas, in Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981), the 
Supreme Court of the United States upheld the all-male 
draft as constitutional and held that Congress had ‘‘de-
termined that any future draft, which would be facilitated 
by the registration scheme, would be characterized by a 
need for combat troops’’; 
Whereas, in 2015, nearly all combat positions in the all-vol-
unteer force within the Armed Forces became open to 
any woman as long as the woman could meet certain 
physical fitness requirements; 
Whereas only a small subset of women are able to meet the 
physical fitness requirements for combat roles, and phys-
ical disadvantages between men and women often result 
in excessive fatigue and more frequent injuries to women; 
Whereas the Ground Combat Element Integrated Task Force 
within the United States Marine Corps found that the 
musculoskeletal rate of injury for a woman was nearly 
twice the rate of injury for a man, and research at the 
Infantry Training Battalion found that the rate of injury 
for an enlisted women was 6 times the rate of injury for 
a man; 
Whereas the results of United States Marine Corps research 
led General Joseph F. Dunford, Jr., a former com-
mandant of the United States Marine Corps, to seek an 
exemption to ensure certain Marine combat roles were 
only available to men; 
Whereas all members of Congress should have the oppor-
tunity to review the rationale provided by General 
Dunford for requesting the exemption;

•HRES 606 IH 
Whereas, in 2018, the United States Army replaced the gen-
der-separate Army Physical Fitness Test with the gen-
der-neutral Army Combat Fitness Test; 
Whereas United States Army data has demonstrated a fail 
rate ranging between 65 percent and 84 percent for 
women and between 10 percent and 30 percent for men 
on the Army Combat Fitness Test since its inception; 
and 
Whereas mandating the registration of women for Selective 
Service System has the potential to unduly increase the 
fatality and injury risks of women in the United States 
and hinder combat unit readiness in battle: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that the House of Representatives should not 
2
pass legislation mandating the registration of women for

Selective Service System.
