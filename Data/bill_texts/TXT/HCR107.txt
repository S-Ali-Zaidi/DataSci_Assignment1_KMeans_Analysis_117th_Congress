Whereas more than 1 out of 4 older adults in the United 
States falls each year; 
Whereas falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths 
among adults aged 65 and older each year; 
Whereas falls are the leading cause of both fatal and nonfatal 
injuries among adults aged 65 and older; 
Whereas beyond the loss of life and independence, the CDC 
reports that the total direct medical cost of fall-related 
injuries 
for 
older 
adults 
is 
approximately 
$50,000,000,000 
annually, 
including 
approximately 
$29,000,000,000 
paid 
by 
Medicare, 
approximately 
$9,000,000,000 paid by Medicaid, and approximately 
$12,000,000,000 paid by private and out-of-pocket 
payors; 
Whereas if the rate of increase in falls is not slowed, the an-
nual cost of fall injuries will surpass $101,000,000,000 
by 2030; 
Whereas many falls could be prevented by addressing modifi-
able biological, behavioral, and environmental risk fac-
tors; and 
Whereas evidence-based programs reduce falls by utilizing 
cost-effective strategies, such as exercise programs to im-
prove balance and strength, medication management, vi-
sion improvement, reduction of home hazards, and falls 
prevention education: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That Congress—

(1) supports the designation of ‘‘National Fall 
3
Prevention Awareness Week’’;
