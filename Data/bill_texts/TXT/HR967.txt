Whereas child bereavement disproportionately impacts minor-
ity communities; 
Whereas children losing primary caregivers have a higher risk 
of experiencing substance abuse and mental health prob-
lems, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic 
stress disorder; 
Whereas bereaved children are at higher risk of reduced em-
ployment and housing instability, and experience lower 
rates of academic attainment and higher dropout rates; 
Whereas parental bereavement is associated with a higher 
likelihood of risky behaviors that threaten the health and 
safety of bereaved children; 
Whereas the impacts of caregiver loss on children are ampli-
fied during COVID–19 due to a lack of stable social sup-
port systems commonly provided with consistent school or 
community; and 
Whereas the long-term consequences of caregiver loss during 
the COVID–19 pandemic are still unknown: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

2
reaved children and the unknown long-term con-
3
sequences of caregiver loss during the COVID–19

pandemic;

minorities; and
