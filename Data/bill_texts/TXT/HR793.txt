RESOLUTION 
To express the support of the House of Representatives 
that no governmental entity should designate what jobs 
are deemed essential and nonessential. 
Whereas government entities determined which businesses 
could remain open during the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas this intervention prevented Americans from earning 
a paycheck to support themselves; 
Whereas these actions forced many workers onto government 
programs instead of working wage paying jobs; 
Whereas no one should exchange the ability to earn a pay-
check for dependence on government;

Whereas any job that provides a paycheck to cover living ex-
penses is essential for the individual; 
Whereas many businesses were never able to recover from

dation of individual liberties including the ability to work 
and earn a living: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives ex-
