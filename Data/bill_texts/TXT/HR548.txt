following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Financial 
Services 
RESOLUTION 
Denouncing the horrors of socialism. 
Whereas socialist ideology necessitates a concentration of 
power that has time and time again collapsed into Com-
munist regimes, totalitarian rule, and brutal dictator-
ships; 
Whereas socialism has repeatedly led to famine and mass 
murders, and the killing of over 100,000,000 people 
worldwide; 
Whereas many of the greatest crimes in history were com-
mitted by socialist ideologues, including Vladimir Lenin, 
Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, Pol Pot, Kim 
Jong Il, Kim Jong Un, Daniel Ortega, Hugo Chavez, and 
Nicola´s Maduro; 
Whereas tens of millions died in the Bolshevik Revolution, at 
least 10,000,000 people were sent to the gulags in the 
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), and millions

more starved in the Terror-Famine (Holodomor) in 
Ukraine; 
Whereas between 15,000,000 and 55,000,000 people starved 
to death in the wake of famine and devastation caused 
by the Great Leap Forward in China; 
Whereas the socialist experiment in Cambodia led to the kill-
ing fields in which over a million people were gruesomely 
murdered; 
Whereas up to 3,500,000 people have starved in North 
Korea, dividing a land of freedom from a land of destitu-
tion; 
Whereas the Castro regime in Cuba expropriated the land of 
Cuban farmers and the businesses of Cuban entre-
preneurs, stealing their possessions and their livelihoods, 
and exiling millions with nothing but the clothes on their 
backs; 
Whereas the implementation of socialism in Venezuela has 
turned a once-prosperous nation into a failed state with 
the world’s highest rate of inflation; 
Whereas the author of the Declaration of Independence, 
President Thomas Jefferson, wrote, ‘‘To take from one, 
because it is thought that his own industry and that of 
his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to 
others, who, or whose fathers have not exercised equal in-
dustry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle 
of association, the guarantee to every one of a free exer-
cise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it.’’; 
Whereas the ‘‘Father of the Constitution’’, President James 
Madison, wrote that it ‘‘is not a just government, nor is 
property secure under it, where the property which a man 
has in his personal safety and personal liberty, is violated

by arbitrary seizures of one class of citizens for the serv-
ice of the rest’’; and 
Whereas the United States of America was founded on the 
belief in the sanctity of the individual, to which the 
collectivistic system of socialism in all of its forms is fun-
damentally and necessarily opposed: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives de-
1
nounces socialism in all its forms, and opposes the imple-
2
mentation of socialist policies in the United States of 
3
America.
