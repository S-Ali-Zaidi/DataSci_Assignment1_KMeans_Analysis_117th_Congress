Whereas after the Civil War, HBCUs continued to provide 
education and valuable guidance to formerly enslaved stu-
dents; 
Whereas slavery and segregation served as barriers to Black 
students’ successful enrollment in colleges and univer-
sities; 
Whereas notable Black Americans, such as Supreme Court 
Justice Thurgood Marshall and W.E.B. Du Bois, at-
tended an HBCU; 
Whereas, on May 17, 1954, Brown v. Board of Education of 
Topeka established that racial segregation in public 
schools is unconstitutional; 
Whereas, on November 8, 1965, Congress officially defined a 
historically Black college or university (HBCU) as an in-
stitution of higher learning that was accredited and es-
tablished before 1964, and whose principal mission was 
the education of African Americans; 
Whereas Congress calls for the issuance of a Presidential 
proclamation to mark National HBCU Conference Week; 
and 
Whereas HBCUs continue to remain integral to the United 
States of America academically, socially, and economi-
cally: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes National HBCU Conference 
2
Week; and 
3
(2) reaffirms its support for HBCUs and stu-
4
dents attending HBCUs.
