Whereas, in March 2021, the number of single adults that il-
legally crossed the border increased from 132,806 to 
410,460, resulting in a 209-percent increase over March 
2020; 
Whereas, in January 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion (CBP) took 78,442 migrants into custody, followed 
by an apprehension of 101,117 in February, 173,337 in 
March, and 178,854 in April; 
Whereas illegal crossings so far in fiscal year 2021 are on 
track to be the highest recorded in 20 years; 
Whereas 90 percent of the narcotics that enter the United 
States come across the southern border; 
Whereas, so far in fiscal year 2021, CBP has seized 176,517 
pounds of marijuana, 119,450 pounds of methamphet-
amine, 19,312 pounds of cocaine, and 7,039 pounds of 
fentanyl at the southern border; 
Whereas CBP has seized more fentanyl so far in fiscal year 
2021 than in all of fiscal year 2020; 
Whereas the House of Representatives, under Democratic 
leadership, has failed to adequately respond to the crisis 
at the southern border; 
Whereas the Federal Government’s inaction has directly im-
pacted Texas, leading Governor Greg Abbott to pursue 
Texas’ own border wall to ensure the safety of the State; 
and 
Whereas, while Texas and other southern border States are 
merely the front line, illegal immigration is a problem 
that affects every State, regardless of proximity to the 
border, and requires the attention and action of all Gov-
ernors: Now, therefore, be it
