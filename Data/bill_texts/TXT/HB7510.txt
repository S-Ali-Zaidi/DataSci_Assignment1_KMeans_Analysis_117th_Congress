‘‘to elevate the character and advance the interests

of the profession of teaching; and to promote the

cause of education in the United States’’ and re-
4
mains the only labor union that has a Federal char-

(2) By continuing to hold its Federal charter, 
7
the NEA is basically receiving a seal of approval 
8
from and support of their actions by Congress. 
9
(3) The NEA can no longer be considered a 
10
public service worthy of its Federal charter as it has 
11
drifted substantially from its core mission and be-
12
come a massive political operation dedicated to elect-
13
ing Democrats and imposing a radical progressive 
14
agenda on America’s schools. 
15
(4) In July 2019, NEA members held a con-
16
ference and voted against adding a business item to 
17
the organization that stated: ‘‘The National Edu-
18
cation Association will re-dedicate itself to the pur-
19
suit of increased student learning in every public 
20
school in America by putting a renewed emphasis on 
21
quality education. NEA will make student learning 
22
the priority of the association.’’.

(6) According to disclosures made to the Office 
4
of Labor-Management Standards, from September 
5
2019 to August 2021 the NEA spent over $116.7 
6
million on political activities and lobbying, and in 
7
the 2020 election cycle, 95.7 percent of candidate 
8
campaign contributions by the NEA went to Demo-
9
crat candidates. 
10
(7) The NEA adopted measures in July 2021 
11
to support critical race theory, calling it ‘‘reasonable 
12
and appropriate’’, and to spend $56,500 on re-
13
searching and shaming organizations fighting the in-
14
clusion of critical race theory in schools. 
15
(8) The NEA and other teacher unions stood in 
16
the way of reopening schools in 2020 and 2021 by 
17
threatening strikes, donating to Democrat can-
18
didates that backed school closures, and influencing 
19
CDC guidance process to make it harder for schools 
20
to reopen.
