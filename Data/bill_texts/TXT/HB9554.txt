other wealthy nations to pay developing countries for 
1
‘‘loss and damage’’ caused by natural disasters. 
2
(2) The world’s top polluter, China, generated 
3
more CO2 in 2019 than the United States and the 
4
next four largest countries combined, and many indi-
5
vidual corporations in China have more sway over 
6
warming temperatures than most developed coun-
7
tries as a whole. 
8
(3) Despite being the world’s second-largest 
9
economy, China is still categorized as a ‘‘developing’’ 
10
country by the United Nations and enjoys the same 
11
differential treatment afforded to nations like Guin-
12
ea-Bissau and Yemen. 
13
(4) Other countries the United Nations has 
14
identified as ‘‘developing’’, and are therefore still eli-
15
gible for the $1,000,000,000 in United States tax-
16
payer dollars committed by President Biden to the 
17
‘‘Loss and Damage’’ fund include the Islamic Re-
18
public of Afghanistan, the Russian Federation, the 
19
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Islamic Republic of 
20
Iran, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the United 
21
Arab Emirates, the Republic of Cuba, and the 
22
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

commitments have failed to back those pledges, and 
1
are larger polluters than most developed nations. 
2
(6) In December 2009, at the United Nations 
3
Climate Change Conference, Todd Stern, President 
4
Obama’s special envoy for climate change, outright 
5
rejected arguments by diplomats from developing na-
6
tions that the United States owes them hundreds of 
7
billions of dollars in reparations for decades of 
8
American emissions, stating, ‘‘I actually completely 
9
reject the notion of a debt or reparations or any-
10
thing of the like’’, he said. 
11
(7) President Biden’s own climate envoy, John 
12
Kerry, was quoted at the COP27 summit on Novem-
13
ber 12th, 2022, stating, ‘‘It’s a well-known fact that 
14
the United States and many other countries will not 
15
establish . . . some sort of legal structure that is tied 
16
to compensation or liability’’, yet, a week later, the 
17
Biden Administration had caved to activist demands, 
18
and Kerry released a statement saying he ‘‘wel-
19
comes’’ the fund’s creation.
