Chauvin’s defense attorney, ‘‘I’ll give you that Congress-
woman Waters may have given you something on appeal 
that may result in this whole trial being overturned.’’; 
Whereas Judge Cahill stated, ‘‘I wish elected officials would 
stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that 
is disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial 
branch and our function.’’; and 
Whereas Judge Cahill stated, ‘‘I think if they want to give 
their opinions, they should do so in a respectful manner, 
and in a manner that is consistent with their oath to the 
Constitution. To respect the coequal branch of govern-
ment. Their failure to do so I think is abhorrent.’’: Now,
