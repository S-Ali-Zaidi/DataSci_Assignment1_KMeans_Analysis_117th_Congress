RESOLUTION 
Condemning the statements of Representative Pramila 
Jayapal of Washington. 
Whereas, on October 8, 1997, Hamas was designated as a 
foreign terrorist organization by the United States Gov-
ernment and actively seeks the destruction of the State 
of Israel, uses Palestinians as human shields, and is re-
sponsible for the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip; 
Whereas, on May 10, 2021, Hamas, an Iranian-backed ter-
rorist organization, fired approximately 150 rockets from 
the Gaza Strip targeting the State of Israel; 
Whereas Israel has a right of self-defense against radical Is-
lamic terrorism;

•HRES 431 IH 
Whereas, on May 20, 2021, Representative Pramila Jayapal 
of Washington stated on CNN, ‘‘Well, we condemn 
Hamas’ firing of those rockets, but I think you have to 
look at what prompted even that behavior.’’; 
Whereas Representative Pramila Jayapal further stated, 
‘‘this has been a pattern of action from Israel that frank-
ly has taken away the idea even of a two-state solution, 
and has led to increased hopelessness from the Pales-
tinian people.’’; 
Whereas Representative Pramila Jayapal said ‘‘I think what 
Hamas has done is—obviously we condemn that—but we 
have to look at the power balance here, or imbalance as 
it were, and we have to put more responsibility on Israel 
in maintaining peace in the region.’’; 
Whereas blaming Israel for Hamas rocket attacks and justi-
fying terrorism is a form of anti-Semitic speech; and 
Whereas spreading hateful misinformation about the State of 
Israel feeds anti-Semitism against Jewish people at home 
and abroad: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) condemns the statements of Representative 
2
Pramila Jayapal of Washington; 
3
(2) condemns anti-Semitic hate speech; and 
4
(3) reaffirms its commitment to the State of 
5
Israel and supports its right of self-defense.
