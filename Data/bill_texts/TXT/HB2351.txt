SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Supporting Accurate 
2
Views of Emergency Services Act of 2021’’ or the ‘‘911 
3
SAVES Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Public Safety Telecommunicators play a 
7
critical role in emergency response. 
8
(2) The work Public Safety Telecommunicators 
9
perform goes far beyond merely relaying information 
10
between the public and first responders. 
11
(3) When responding to reports of missing, ab-
12
ducted, and sexually exploited children, the informa-
13
tion obtained and actions taken by Public Safety 
14
Telecommunicators form the foundation for an effec-
15
tive response. 
16
(4) When a hostage taker or suicidal person 
17
calls 9–1–1, the first contact is with the Public Safe-
18
ty Telecommunicator whose negotiation skills can 
19
prevent the situation from getting worse. 
20
(5) During active shooter incidents, Public 
21
Safety Telecommunicators coach callers through 
22
first aid and give advice to prevent further harm, all 
23
while collecting vital information to provide situa-
24
tional awareness for responding officers.

(6) And when police officers, firefighters, and 
1
Emergency Medical Technicians are being shot at, 
2
their calls for help go to Public Safety Telecommu-
3
nicators. 
4
(7) They are often communicating with people 
5
in great distress, harm, fear, or injury, while em-
6
ploying their experience and training to recognize a 
7
critical piece of information. 
8
(8) In fact, there have been incidents in which 
9
Public Safety Telecommunicators, recognizing the 
10
sound of a racked shotgun, have prevented serious 
11
harm or death of law enforcement officers who 
12
would have otherwise walked into a trap. 
13
(9) This work comes with an extreme emotional 
14
and physical impact that is compounded by long 
15
hours and the around-the-clock nature of the job. 
16
(10) Indeed, research has suggested that Public 
17
Safety Telecommunicators are exposed to trauma 
18
that may lead to the development of posttraumatic 
19
stress disorder. 
20
(11) Recognizing the risks associated with expo-
21
sure to traumatic events, some agencies provide 
22
Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD) teams to 
23
lessen the psychological impact and accelerate recov-

ery for Public Safety Telecommunicators and first 
1
responders, alike. 
2
(12) The Standard Occupational Classification 
3
system is designed and maintained solely for statis-
4
tical purposes, and is used by federal statistical 
5
agencies to classify workers and jobs into occupa-
6
tional categories for the purpose of collecting, calcu-
7
lating, analyzing, or disseminating data. 
8
(13) Occupations in the Standard Occupational 
9
Classification are classified based on work performed 
10
and, in some cases, on the skills, education, or train-
11
ing needed to perform the work. 
12
(14) Classifying public safety telecommunica-
13
tors as Protective Service Occupations would correct 
14
an inaccurate representation in the Standard Occu-
15
pational Classification, recognize these professionals 
16
for the lifesaving work they perform, and better 
17
align the Standard Occupational Classification with 
18
related classification systems.

The Director of the Office of Management and Budg-
22
et shall not later than 30 days after the date of the enact-
23
ment of this Act, categorize public safety telecommunica-
