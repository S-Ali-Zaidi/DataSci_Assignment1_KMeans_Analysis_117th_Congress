RESOLUTION 
Commemorating the 20th anniversary of 9/11. 
Whereas 20 years ago, on Tuesday, September 11, 2001, as 
Americans went about their daily lives, terrorists hijacked 
4 civilian aircraft and deliberately flew the aircraft into 
the North Tower of the World Trade Center, the South 
Tower of the World Trade Center, and the Pentagon; 
Whereas terrorists hijacked a 4th civilian aircraft, which was 
intended for a target in the District of Columbia, but 
which crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania; 
Whereas thousands of on-duty and off-duty firefighters, po-
lice officers, emergency medical technicians, and other re-
sponders from around the country rushed to the scenes 
and took heroic action to save lives at the World Trade 
Center and the Pentagon; 
Whereas office workers, military personnel, residents, and 
students showed incredible courage and support for their 
fellow Americans in helping each other escape the attack 
and flee to safety, often at the expense of their own lives; 
Whereas the September 11, 2001, attack was the deadliest 
terrorist attack in American history, killing 2,996 people 
in the initial attack (including 343 members of the New 
York City Fire Department, 60 law enforcement officers 
from the New York City Police Department and the Port 
Authority of New York and New Jersey, and 55 military 
personnel) and leading to the loss of thousands of United 
States servicemembers in post-9/11 military operations; 
Whereas Congress acted quickly after the attacks in a bipar-
tisan fashion to create a Victim Compensation Fund to 
support those injured and the family members of those

who died, provide funds to rebuild Lower Manhattan, and 
investigate the attack and prevent future terrorist at-
tacks; 
Whereas the attack created one of the worst environmental 
disasters in history, as hundreds of tons of toxic dust and 
debris spread over Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, cov-
ering first responders, workers, residents, and students 
and filling apartment buildings, offices, stores, and 
schools; 
Whereas the Environmental Protection Agency, despite the 
clear evidence of toxic debris, assured everyone that the 
air in Lower Manhattan and at the World Trade Center 
in particular was safe to breathe and sent thousands of 
responders to the pile, thousands of office workers back 
to work and students back to school, and thousands of 
residents back to their homes without adequate protective 
equipment or a comprehensive cleanup of the area; 
Whereas, as a result of these lies, thousands of responders 
and survivors of the attack were exposed to toxins and 
have been diagnosed with 9/11-related illnesses, including 
cancers, and thousands have died from a 9/11-related ill-
ness; 
Whereas Congress came together in 2011 to pass the James 
Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010, 
which created the World Trade Center Health Program 
and reopened the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund that 
together provide health and support for responders and 
survivors struggling with 9/11-related illnesses; 
Whereas, in 2016, Congress made the World Trade Center 
Health Program permanent and, in 2019, Congress made 
the 9/11 Victim Compensation Program permanent to en-

sure that these programs will be available to responders 
and survivors struggling with 9/11-related illnesses 
throughout their lives; 
Whereas over 110,000 responders and survivors are now en-
rolled in the World Trade Center Health Program from 
all 50 States and nearly every congressional district and 
over $8,600,000,000 in compensation has been paid to 
responders and survivors struggling with 9/11-related ill-
nesses; 
Whereas for the families and friends of those who died on 9/ 
11 and the responders and survivors who are struggling 
with 9/11-related illnesses today, the tragedy of that day 
has never ended; and 
Whereas September 11, 2021, marks the 20th anniversary of 
the attacks: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes that September 11 is a day of 
2
solemn remembrance and calls on all Americans to 
3
observe the 20th anniversary of the September 11 
4
attacks and honor those who lost their lives; 
5
(2) continues to express its deepest sympathy to 
6
those who lost family members and loved ones on 
7
September 11 and in the aftermath of the attacks; 
8
(3) honors the heroism and sacrifice of the fire-
9
fighters, law enforcement officers, military per-
10
sonnel, emergency personnel, and civilians who 
11
risked, and often gave, their lives that day to save 
12
their fellow Americans;
