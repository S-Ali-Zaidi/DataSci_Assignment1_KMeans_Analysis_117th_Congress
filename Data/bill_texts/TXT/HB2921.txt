(1) The United States Postal Service has been 
1
operating a clandestine domestic surveillance pro-
2
gram of Americans’ social media activity known as 
3
the Internet Covert Operations Program (iCOP). 
4
(2) iCOP is part of the United States Postal 
5
Inspection Service which is the law enforcement and 
6
security component of USPS. 
7
(3) The USP Inspection Service is operating 
8
outside of its USPS jurisdiction when it monitors 
9
internet users’ sharing of information as its jurisdic-
10
tion is narrowly defined within postal mail only. 
11
(4) The iCOP program is a violation of privacy; 
12
it encroaches upon the private lives of Americans 
13
and seeks to curb constitutional rights of the First 
14
Amendment. 
15
(5) iCOP is not only illegal for operating out-
16
side of its stated jurisdiction, but also politically mo-
17
tivated in its target.
