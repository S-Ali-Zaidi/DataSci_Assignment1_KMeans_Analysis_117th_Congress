Whereas, on July 3, 1952, the United States District Court 
for the District of Columbia ruled in their favor in Miller 
v. Board of Education of District of Columbia, stating 
that African Americans could not be sent outside a State 
or district to obtain the same education that White stu-

Whereas this ruling led to the construction of the Kendall 
School Division II at Gallaudet in 1953, which educated 
23 Black Deaf children until its closure in 1954 following

schools was unconstitutional: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate
