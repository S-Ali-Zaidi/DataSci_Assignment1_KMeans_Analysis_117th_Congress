ing surge in anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents, which

States to feel fearful and unsafe;

lated to COVID–19, such as the ‘‘Chinese virus’’, 
‘‘Wuhan virus’’, and ‘‘kung flu’’, has perpetuated anti-

harassed, assaulted, and scapegoated for the COVID–19 
pandemic; 
Whereas anti-Asian hate crimes increased by nearly 150 per-
cent in major cities throughout the United States in 
2020;
