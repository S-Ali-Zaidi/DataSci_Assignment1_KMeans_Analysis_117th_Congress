RESOLUTION 
Declaring unconditional war on racism and invidious dis-
crimination and providing for the establishment of a 
Cabinet-level Department of Reconciliation charged with 
eliminating racism and invidious discrimination. 
Whereas this resolution is presented in the spirit of President

symptoms of poverty, but to cure it and, above all, to 
prevent it.’’; 
Whereas President Barack Obama indicated, ‘‘In fact, if we 
hadn’t declared ‘unconditional war on poverty in Amer-

today.’’; 
Whereas some of the programs produced by the War on Pov-
erty include Medicaid, Medicare, expanded Social Secu-
rity, and Head Start—all of which are still needed today; 
Whereas racism and invidious discrimination—like poverty in 
1964—remain pervasive in our country; 
Whereas history is replete with examples of victims of racism 
and invidious discrimination being denied life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness; 
Whereas systemic and institutionalized racism and invidious 
discrimination exist in virtually all areas of American life, 
including policing, criminal justice, housing, banking, vot-
ing, employment, education, the environment, and health 
care; and 
Whereas the protestations in the aftermath of the tragic 
death of George Floyd are a clear indication that it has 
become necessary for Congress to take decisive, imme-
diate and long-term legislative action to address the 
elimination of racism and invidious discrimination: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) condemns racism and invidious discrimina-

tion as evil and antithetical to the United States
