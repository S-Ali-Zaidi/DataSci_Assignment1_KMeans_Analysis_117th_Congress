Ohio) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform 
RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of ‘‘Telehealth Awareness Week’’. 
Whereas telehealth allows a health care practitioner to fur-
nish health care services to a patient or a practitioner at 
a different physical location than the health care practi-
tioner; 
Whereas telehealth has played a significant role in supporting 
access to quality health care services for millions of pa-
tients during the COVID–19 public health emergency 
and will continue to be essential beyond the end of the 
public health emergency; 
Whereas more than 2 in 5 Medicare beneficiaries used tele-
health during the first year of the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas following the unprecedented use of telehealth and 
virtual care services in response to the public health

emergency, telehealth now represents a significant per-
cent of care delivery, confirming the need to balance in- 
person and virtual care in the health care system; 
Whereas while Medicare beneficiaries have doubled their use 
of telehealth compared to prepandemic levels, overall uti-
lization of health care services remains relatively stable; 
Whereas telehealth and virtual care services continue to pro-
vide patients and families with safe, appropriate, and 
high-quality care where and when they need it, and 91 
percent of Medicare beneficiaries are satisfied with their 
telehealth experiences; 
Whereas telehealth allows health care providers to securely 
connect with patients wherever they are when an in-per-
son interaction is not clinically necessary or available and 
expands access to health care services for patients in 
need of primary and specialty care, enabling the health 
care system to do more good for more people; 
Whereas telehealth is a bipartisan issue and Members of Con-
gress from both sides of the political aisle and both sides 
of Capitol Hill are dedicated to ensuring patients con-
tinue to have the choice to access telehealth once the 
COVID–19 public health emergency ends; 
Whereas the United States must help improve broader access 
to telehealth services for all individuals, including mem-
bers of rural and underserved communities; and 
Whereas ‘‘Telehealth Awareness Week’’ unites the efforts of 
patients, caregivers, health care providers, policymakers, 
and other stakeholders to advance the role of telehealth 
in health care: Now, therefore, be it
