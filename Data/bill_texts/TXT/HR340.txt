Condemning the Government of Russia’s attempted assas-
sination of Mr. Navalny and criminal acts to intimidate

ing partaking in peaceful and constitutionally protected 
protests in Russia; 
Whereas the investigative work of Mr. Navalny’s Anti-Cor-
ruption Foundation has uncovered corruption at the 
highest levels of the Government of Russia, including ac-
tivities orchestrated by Russian dictator, Vladimir Putin, 
and the oligarchs closely associated to him; 
Whereas Russia is a signatory of the Helsinki Final Act 
obliging the Government of Russia to respect and protect 
human rights, including freedom of thought, conscience, 
or belief; 
Whereas the Government of Russia has a deeply disturbing 
history of employing extrajudicial assassinations and 
other forms of violence to cover up its crimes and silence 
independent political leaders, anticorruption investigators, 
and prodemocracy activists, including Boris Nemtsov, 
Vladimir Kara-Murza, Alexander Litvinenko, and Sergei 
Magnitsky who died tragically in a Russian prison; 
Whereas, on August 20, 2020, Mr. Navalny was poisoned by 
the Russian security forces with a Novichok nerve agent, 
putting him in grave condition which required him to be 
placed into a medically induced coma; 
Whereas Mr. Navalny was evacuated to Berlin, Germany, 
where he eventually recovered; 
Whereas, on January 17, 2021, Mr. Navalny bravely re-
turned to Russia to continue the fight for democracy de-
spite outstanding arrest warrants against him; 
Whereas upon his arrival at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport, 
Mr. Navalny was immediately detained by Russian offi-
cials on false charges, and after a sham trial on February 
2, 2021, was convicted to 2.5 years imprisonment;

Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 for the second time in 
response to the Russian Government’s poisoning of Mr.

Whereas Mr. Navalny was transferred to Penal Colony 2 
(IK–2), where he complained of torture, sleep depriva-
tion, denial of medical care, and other gross human 
rights abuses; 
Whereas Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has played a crit-
ical role in ensuring Russian and global audiences hear 
the truth of the Government of Russia’s gross human 
rights abuses towards Mr. Navalny and other Russian 
political prisoners; 
Whereas Mr. Navalny’s health has rapidly deteriorated in 
prison, and on March 31, 2021, he started a hunger 
strike to protest the lack of medical access and the grim 
prison conditions; 
Whereas reports indicate that Mr. Navalny is experiencing 
renal failure and heart problems, and in a moribund 
state; 
Whereas European Union High Representative for Foreign 
Affairs Josep Borrell said, ‘‘we make the Russian au-
thorities responsible for the health of Mr. Navalny,’’ and

Mr. Navalny; and 
Whereas Mr. Navalny’s life is in grave and immediate dan-
ger: Now, therefore, be it
