Whereas the right to life is one of the founding principles of 
our Nation; 
Whereas the Constitution does not include a right to abor-
tion; 
Whereas the rights of States are written into the Constitution 
and should be respected and supported; 
Whereas local, State, and Federal Government has the duty 
to protect the life of all individuals regardless of race, na-
tional origin, sex, age, creed, or ability; 
Whereas the development of scientific and medical technology 
has demonstrated repeatedly the humanity of the unborn 
child; 
Whereas, by 15 weeks, the time by which the law at the cen-
ter of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organiza-
tion case would protect unborn babies, we know that ba-
bies have fully developed hearts, can feel pain, can suck 
their thumbs, and will kick and jump if startled; 
Whereas more than 63,000,000 lives have been lost over the 
past 50 years because of the unethical decision of Roe v. 
Wade; 
Whereas, of all the pregnancies that resulted in either live 
birth or abortion in the last reported year, about 1 in 5 
pregnancies resulted in abortion; 
Whereas every State and territory provide necessary re-
sources to help women and families with unplanned preg-
nancies to find life-affirming alternatives to abortion; 
Whereas faith-based organizations and churches have a reli-
gious calling to love their neighbors and serve those in 
need, especially unborn children;

businesses, or other organizations, play an active role up-
holding the dignity of life and providing care for children 
and families in their communities; 
Whereas no woman should stand alone during and after her 
pregnancy; 
Whereas local nonprofit network organizations and pregnancy 
centers provide critical services to mothers, children, and 
families in need in their communities; 
Whereas adoption serves as an alternative life-affirming op-
tion for unplanned pregnancies; 
Whereas, on June 24, 2022, the United States Supreme 
Court issued its decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Wom-
en’s Health Organization case which overturns Roe v. 
Wade; 
Whereas it is the responsibility of the American people to love

fore, be it
