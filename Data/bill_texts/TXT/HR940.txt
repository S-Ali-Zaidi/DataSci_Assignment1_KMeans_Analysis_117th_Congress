Whereas, in 2019, through investment in innovation and 
technology by domestic oil and gas companies, the United 
States became truly energy secure and a net energy ex-
porter for the first time in nearly 70 years; 
Whereas, on day 1 of his Presidency, President Biden took 
executive action to limit the energy production of the 
United States, including by revoking a key permit for the 
Keystone XL pipeline and issuing a moratorium on en-
ergy production on Federal lands and waters, thereby 
once again making the United States energy dependent; 
Whereas the Keystone XL pipeline would have imported 
830,000 barrels of crude oil per day from Canada into 
the United States, compared to the 595,000 barrels of 
crude oil the United States subsequently began to import 
daily from Russia at the end of 2020; 
Whereas President Biden has taken further action to limit 
the energy production of the United States, including 
weaponizing the regulatory process and prohibiting the fi-
nancing of fossil fuel projects overseas; 
Whereas, in 2021, energy prices rose to a 7-year high, and 
inflation hit a 40-year high, leading to Americans having 
to choose between putting food on the table and heating 
their homes or driving their vehicles; 
Whereas Fatih Birol, Director of the International Energy 
Agency, accused Russia of intentionally worsening Eu-
rope’s energy crisis by withholding up to one-third of its 
natural gas exports to Europe; 
Whereas President Biden asked the Organization of the Pe-
troleum Exporting Countries and Russia to boost crude 
oil production and inappropriately used the United States

Strategic Petroleum Reserve to artificially change oil 
markets rather than increase domestic energy production; 
Whereas other Democrats subsequently suggested that Presi-
dent Biden ban crude oil and liquified natural gas ex-
ports to allies of the United States, policy decisions that 
would further increase domestic energy prices and weak-
en the position of the United States as a global energy 
leader; 
Whereas President Biden then inappropriately requested the 
Federal Trade Commission to immediately investigate 
whether ‘‘illegal conduct’’ by domestic oil and gas compa-
nies artificially lifted energy prices, and, following Rus-
sia’s invasion of Ukraine, publicly asked domestic oil and 
gas companies to refrain from using the invasion as an 
excuse to raise prices even more; 
Whereas, in May 2021, President Biden waived sanctions on 
the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would have trans-
ported natural gas from Russia to Germany, and only de-
cided to reinstate sanctions after Germany halted the cer-
tification process for the pipeline on February 23, 2022; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, Vladimir Putin instructed 
Russian forces to invade Ukraine, leading to Brent crude 
oil prices immediately rising above $100 for the first time 
since 2014 and fears of global energy shortages; 
Whereas domestic oil and natural gas producers play a crit-
ical role in supporting the European allies of the United 
States with access to a stable supply of reliable and af-
fordable energy; 
Whereas President Biden and Ursula von der Leyen, Presi-
dent of the European Commission, previously stated, 
‘‘We [the United States and European Union] commit to

intensifying our strategic energy cooperation for security 
of supply and will work together to make available reli-
able, and affordable energy supplies to citizens and busi-
nesses in the EU and its neighborhood’’; and 
Whereas continuing to limit energy production in the United 
States will only provide further leverage and funding for 
Russia and continue to weaken global energy security: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that— 
2
(1) the energy independence of the United 
3
States is critical to national security and should in-
4
clude the production and use of all available energy 
5
sources, including coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear, and 
6
renewables, as well as strategic minerals critical to 
7
electric vehicles and other clean energy sources; and 
8
(2) President Biden should take immediate ac-
9
tion to restore the energy security of the United 
10
States and provide allies of the United States with 
11
an affordable and secure supply of energy, including 
12
by— 
13
(A) streamlining the permitting process for 
14
domestic energy infrastructure; 
15
(B) acting in a timely manner on the ap-
16
proval requests pending before the Department 
17
of Energy to authorize additional export vol-
