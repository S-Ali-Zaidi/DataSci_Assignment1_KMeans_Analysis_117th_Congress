RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of March 2021 as National 
Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. 
Whereas colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of can-
cer death among men and women combined in the United 
States; 
Whereas in 2021, approximately 149,500 Americans will be 
diagnosed with colorectal cancer and approximately 
53,000 Americans will die from it; 
Whereas colorectal cancer is one of the most highly prevent-
able forms of cancer because screening tests can find pol-
yps that can be removed before becoming cancerous;

•HRES 209 IH 
Whereas screening tests can detect colorectal cancer early, 
when treatment works best; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention esti-
mates that if every individual aged 50 or older had reg-
ular screening tests, as many as 60 percent of deaths 
from colorectal cancer could be prevented; 
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for patients with localized 
colorectal cancer is 90 percent, but only 39 percent of all 
diagnoses occur at this stage; 
Whereas colorectal cancer screenings can effectively reduce 
colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, yet, 1 in 3 
adults over 50 years of age are not up to date with rec-
ommended colorectal cancer screening; 
Whereas public awareness and education campaigns on 
colorectal cancer prevention, screening, and symptoms 
are held during the month of March each year; and 
Whereas educational efforts can help provide information to 
the public of methods of prevention and screening, as 
well as about symptoms for early detection: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of National 
2
Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month; and 
3
(2) encourages the people of the United States 
4
to observe the month with appropriate awareness 
5
and educational activities.
