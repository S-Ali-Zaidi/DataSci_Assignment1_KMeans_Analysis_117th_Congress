Whereas there are around 32,000,000 small businesses in the 
United States that support nearly 61,000,000 jobs; 
Whereas every congressional district in the United States 
contains a small business; 
Whereas thousands of small business establishments still face 
significant challenges recovering from the COVID–19 
pandemic; 
Whereas small businesses have played an integral role in re-
building the economy of the Nation; 
Whereas Congress established the Small Business Adminis-
tration in 1953 to aid, counsel, assist, and protect inter-
ests of small business to ensure that a fair proportion of 
total purchases, contracts, and subcontracts for property 
and services for the Federal Government are placed with 
small businesses, to make certain access to critical capital 
is made available to such small businesses, and to main-
tain and strengthen the overall economy; 
Whereas the Small Business Administration has helped small 
businesses with access to critical lending opportunities, 
played a key role in ensuring full and open competition 
for government contracts, and improved the economic en-
vironment in which small businesses compete; and 
Whereas May 2, 2022, through May 5, 2022, would be an 
appropriate week to celebrate ‘‘National Small Business 
Week’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
