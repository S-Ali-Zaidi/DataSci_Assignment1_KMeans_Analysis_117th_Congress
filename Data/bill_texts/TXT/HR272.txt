messages, and at least two people armed with a handgun 
and knives were arrested; 
Whereas, on January 27, 2021, the Department of Homeland 
Security issued a National Terrorism Advisory System 
Bulletin warned of a heightened threat environment due 
to ‘‘ideologically-motivated extremists with objections to 
the exercise of governmental authority and the presi-
dential transition as well as other perceived grievances 
fueled by false narratives, could continue to mobilize to 
incite or commit violence’’; 
Whereas the Bulletin made no mention of Antifa, the term 
‘‘false narratives’’ is nowhere defined, and the particular 
incidents referenced go unidentified; 
Whereas section 2331 of title 18, United States Code, defines 
‘‘domestic terrorism’’ to mean, in part, activities that in-
volve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation 
of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State; 
acts that appear or intend to intimidate or coerce a civil-
ian population; or acts to affect the conduct of a govern-
ment by mass destruction; and that these activities occur 
primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United 
States; 
Whereas there is no place for violence in the disagreements 
between people in the United States; and 
Whereas the diversity of ideas and opinions should be cele-
brated and shared peacefully with one another or dem-
onstrated peacefully through the rights provided in the 
First Amendment of the United States Constitution: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
