Wall Street Day’’. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
JUNE 1, 2021 
Mr. TORRES of New York submitted the following resolution; which was 
referred to the Committee on Oversight and Reform 
RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of the 1st day in 
June as ‘‘Black Wall Street Day’’. 
Whereas the Greenwood District in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was 
one of the most prosperous Black communities in the 
United States in the early 20th century, and Greenwood’s 
commercial district was known nationally as ‘‘Black Wall 
Street’’; 
Whereas, on May 31 and June 1, 1921, a mob of armed 
White men descended upon Greenwood and launched 
what is now known as the ‘‘Tulsa Race Massacre’’; 
Whereas the White mob’s violence led to the deaths of an es-
timated 300 Black residents, over 800 reports of injuries, 
and the destruction of more than 1,200 homes;

•HRES 454 IH 
Whereas the White mob looted, burned, or otherwise de-
stroyed the 42 square blocks of Greenwood, including 
every church, school, and business; 
Whereas approximately 8,000 Black Tulsans were left home-
less and lost millions of dollars of wealth that went unre-
alized by future generations; 
Whereas government officials blocked redevelopment efforts, 
stalling and preventing the reconstruction of the Green-
wood community and Black Wall Street; and 
Whereas the 1st day in June of each year would be an appro-
priate date to designate as ‘‘Black Wall Street Day’’: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports 
1
the designation of ‘‘Black Wall Street Day’’.
