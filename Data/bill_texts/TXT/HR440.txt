RESOLUTION 
Commending Lithuania for refusing to ratify the European 
Union’s Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement 
with Cuba. 
Whereas Lithuania and the United States have a three-dec-
ade-long special relationship built on shared values, pre-
vailing trust, and a fundamental respect for democracy; 
Whereas the United States-European Union relationship is, 
as stated by the European Commission, built on ‘‘values

logue, cooperation and trade, on the basis of mutual re-
spect, reciprocity, common interest and respect for their 
sovereignty’’; 
Whereas the Communist Government of Cuba has mobilized 
a regime of censorship, detention, torture, and murder of 
political opponents, repression of prodemocracy efforts, 
and unparalleled restrictions on movement and emigra-
tion; 
Whereas the latest wave of repression has targeted the free 
speech, artistic San Isidro Movement, whose leader, Luis 
Manuel Otero Alca´ntara, is currently isolated and under 
police control in a hospital in Havana; 
Whereas cooperative agreements between Western states and 
the Government of Cuba legitimize corruption, political 
repression, and a segregating and suppressive economic 
system while undermining prodemocracy efforts on the 
ground in Cuba, Venezuela, and elsewhere; and 
Whereas Lithuania is the only European Union member state 
which has refused to ratify the PDCA on account of its 
demerits: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) strongly commends Lithuania for standing 
2
with Cuba’s human rights activists by refusing to 
3
ratify the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agree-
4
ment (PDCA); 
5
(2) calls on other European Union members to 
6
follow in the footsteps of Lithuania and annul their 
7
ratification of the PDCA in the course of its ongoing 
8
provisional implementation;
