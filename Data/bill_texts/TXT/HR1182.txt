Whereas news of the end of slavery did not reach frontier 
areas of the United States, and in particular the South-
western States, for more than 21⁄2 years after President 
Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, which was issued

with news that the Civil War had ended and that the 
enslaved were free; 
Whereas African-Americans who had been slaves in the 
Southwest celebrated June 19th, commonly known as 
‘‘Juneteenth Independence Day’’, as the anniversary of 
their emancipation; 
Whereas African-Americans from the Southwest continue the 
tradition of celebrating Juneteenth Independence Day as 
inspiration and encouragement for future generations; 
Whereas for more than 150 years, Juneteenth Independence 
Day celebrations have been held to honor African-Amer-
ican freedom while encouraging self-development and re-
spect for all cultures; 
Whereas, on June 18, 2020, H.R. 7232, the Juneteenth Na-
tional Independence Day Act was introduced and reintro-
duced as H.R. 1320, on February 25, 2021, in the House 
of Representatives, marking the first time in Congress a 
bill had been introduced to declare Juneteenth a Federal 
holiday; 
Whereas, on June 17, 2022, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 
signed into law the bill that established Juneteenth as a 
Federal holiday, one day before the first anniversary of 
the introduction of H.R. 7232, making it the most recent 
addition to the list of Federal holidays; and 
Whereas the faith and strength of character demonstrated by 
former slaves remains an example for all people of the 
United States, regardless of background, religion, or 
race: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That —
