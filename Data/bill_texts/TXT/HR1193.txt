RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of June 23, 2022, 
as National Federal Pell Grant Day. 
Whereas June 23 is the 50th anniversary of the signing of 
the Education Amendments Act of 1972 (Public Law 92– 
318; 86 Stat. 235) by President Richard Nixon; 
Whereas these amendments to the Higher Education Act of 
1965 created the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant, 
later named the Federal Pell Grant in honor of its spon-
sor, Senator Claiborne Pell; 
Whereas, 50 years ago, Senator Pell said ‘‘for it’s through 
this Act that the dream of access, and opportunity for 
college education becomes a reality. It’s in this Act that 
we say a lack of financial wealth should not, and will not, 
stand in the way of a person who has the talent, the de-
sire and the drive to reach out for a college education.’’; 
Whereas, 50 years later, this program to help low-income stu-
dents pursue their higher education goals maintains bi-
partisan support in Congress and bipartisan support with 
the public; 
Whereas in 2022, Federal Pell Grants are helping nearly 
7,000,000 students, or about 40 percent of under-
graduate students, pursue and succeed in higher edu-
cation; 
Whereas Federal Pell Grants help students from all 50 
States, the District of Columbia, and United States terri-
tories, from rural areas to cities and everywhere in be-
tween; 
Whereas the Federal Pell Grant Program is well-targeted to 
meet the needs of students with demonstrated financial

need, with the vast majority of Federal Pell Grant recipi-
ents having family incomes of $40,000 or less; 
Whereas extensive research shows that the Federal Pell 
Grant Program increases college enrollment and comple-
tion among low- and moderate-income students; 
Whereas Federal Pell Grants are critical for students from 
historically underrepresented backgrounds, including 58 
percent of Black students, 47 percent of Hispanic stu-
dents, 51 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native stu-
dents, 48 percent of first-generation students, 52 percent 
of parenting students, and 39 percent of student vet-
erans; 
Whereas students use their Federal Pell Grant at the institu-
tions of their choice, which can include public, private, 2- 
year, and 4-year institutions of higher education; 
Whereas the program is a proven investment to boost future 
economic mobility, with college graduates paying more in 
taxes and earning more in after-tax income than high 
school graduates; and 
Whereas, over the past 50 years, the Federal Pell Grant Pro-
gram has helped over 80 million Americans: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Fed-
2
eral Pell Grant Program; 
3
(2) expresses support for the designation of Na-
4
tional Federal Pell Grant Day this year and in fu-
5
ture years; and
