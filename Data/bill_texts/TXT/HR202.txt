IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
MARCH 9, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR (for herself, Mr. RYAN, and Mr. HUFFMAN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Oversight and 
Reform 
RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the need for a replacement fleet that 
meets the climate goals of the United States, protects 
critical supply chains, and promotes a cleaner, more sta-
ble future for a burgeoning 21st century domestic vehicle 
industry. 
Whereas the United States Postal Service owns and operates 
the largest United States civilian vehicle fleet with over 
200,000 delivery vehicles; 
Whereas close to 140,000 of these vehicles are Grumman 
Long Life Vehicles (LLVs), and have been in service 
since between 1987 and 1994, which are aging, fuel inef-
ficient, and carbon emitting;

Whereas the United States Postal Service spends close to 
$618,000,000 to maintain the fleet and vehicles, and 
close to $432,000,000 on fuel; 
Whereas the current fleet lacks adequate safety protections 
such as airbags, air conditioning, and antilock brakes; 
Whereas, on February 23, 2021, the United States Postal 
Service announced a 10-year contract of up to 
$482,000,000 in initial investments to produce up to 
165,000 vehicles; 
Whereas Postmaster General Louis DeJoy stated that only 
10 percent of the vehicles will be electric vehicles, and the 
remaining 90 percent will be gas powered; 
Whereas the tenure of Louis DeJoy has been highly con-
troversial in the face of concerns with his competence and 
the undue political influence of presidential politics as a 
guiding principle for his decision making at the helm of 
the United States Postal Service; 
Whereas the Biden administration’s Executive Order No. 
14008, ‘‘Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and 
Abroad’’, and our national commitment to the Paris Cli-
mate Accord is undermined by the contract awarded by 
the United States Postal Service; and 
Whereas the development of a modern fleet will help to de-
velop domestic supply chains in the United States, pro-
mote competitiveness of domestic green industry, and 
lead our Nation to a cleaner, better future: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) expresses deep concern with the United

States Postal Service decision-making process and

recent fleet contract because it undermines the na-

(2) urges the United States Postal Service to

freeze the recently awarded contract to purchase

165,000 new vehicles until an expedited review is

conducted to determine there was no inappropriate
