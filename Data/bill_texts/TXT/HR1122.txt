of Light’’. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
MAY 16, 2022 
Mr. MORELLE (for himself and Mr. MAST) submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology 
RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designation of May 16, 2022, as 
the ‘‘National Day of Light’’. 
Whereas the National Day of Light is aimed at raising 
awareness of the vital role of light in our daily lives and 
its importance to 21st-century technology and innovation; 
Whereas for centuries, light-based technologies have provided 
solutions to worldwide challenges in energy, agriculture, 
manufacturing, telecommunications, national security, 
and health; 
Whereas optics and photonics is the study of the fundamental 
properties of light and harnessing them for practical ap-
plications;

Whereas light has revolutionized medicine through tech-
nologies such as x-ray imaging, laser surgery, and cancer 
treatments; 
Whereas light has transformed communication via the inter-
net, a tool we cannot imagine living without today; 
Whereas light has helped us improve transportation safety 
with sensors in vehicles and advanced infrastructure 
monitoring; 
Whereas light has greatly enhanced the ability of the United 
States to gather intelligence, defend the Nation, and pro-
tect its troops in the field; 
Whereas most of what we have observed in the universe is 
known only through light-based technologies, first from 
the visible wavelengths observed by Galileo into x-ray, in-
frared, and radio waves, and even gravitational waves de-
tected by lasers; 
Whereas advanced manufacturing is possible due to light- 
based technologies that can provide custom, precise, and 
high-added value through means such as additive manu-
facturing; 
Whereas quantum computing, sensing, and communication 
systems are largely enabled by light-based technologies; 
Whereas through the National Quantum Initiative Act (Pub-
lic Law 115–368), the United States is accelerating our 
investment in quantum information science and the devel-
opment of commercially available quantum-based tech-
nologies, thereby facilitating growth in the economy of 
the United States and protecting our national security; 
and 
Whereas May 16 is already recognized internationally as the 
Day of Light: Now, therefore, be it
