RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of October 17, 2021, 
as ‘‘National Vitiligo Awareness Day’’. 
Whereas vitiligo is a long-term, chronic disorder that results 
in the loss of pigment in patches on the skin, hair, eyes, 
and inside of the mouth; 
Whereas the condition can result in discomfort, itching, and 
pain, but there is still no known cure; 
Whereas the American Academy of Dermatology refers to vit-
iligo as a life-altering disorder that can cause low self-es-
teem, anger, and depression;

Whereas, according to the American Academy of Derma-
tology, about half of the individuals diagnosed with vit-
iligo are diagnosed before the age of 21; 
Whereas a study by Pediatric Dermatology found that about 
half of all children and adolescents diagnosed with vitiligo 
experienced a decreased quality of life, and some individ-
uals even experienced problems with schoolwork, in-
creased bullying and teasing, trouble with developing 
friendships, and self-confidence issues; 
Whereas a Yale study found that bullied children are two to 
nine times more likely to consider suicide, and the CDC 
reports suicide is the second leading cause of death 
among people between the ages of 10 and 34; and 
Whereas Judith Porter, Ph.D., and Ann Beuf, Ph.D., found 
that social support for children and adolescents with vit-
iligo provided by families, peers, charities, support 
groups, and teachers can greatly improve their quality of 
life and decrease stress related to bullying: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘National Vit-
2
iligo Awareness Day’’; and 
3
(2) recognizes the importance of providing sup-
4
port for individuals diagnosed with vitiligo to im-
5
prove their quality of life.
