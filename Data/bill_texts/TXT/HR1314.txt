RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the vital, lifesaving work of crisis pregnancy 
centers. 
Whereas the modern crisis pregnancy centers were estab-
lished in 1967, with the intent of providing both women 
and men with support and resources when faced with an 
unwanted or unexpected pregnancy; 
Whereas crisis pregnancy centers are nonprofit organizations 
that provide care on a free or low-cost basis for over 
2,300,000 people each year; 
Whereas crisis pregnancy centers provide the option of con-
tinuing pregnancy for women and men who before lacked 
support, education on choices, or financial security;

Whereas crisis pregnancy centers provide a broad range of 
services including ultrasound services, pregnancy tests, 
counseling, childbirth and parenting classes, consulting 
options, and education; 
Whereas crisis pregnancy centers provide parents in need 
with pregnancy and infant products, such as prenatal vi-
tamins, strollers, diapers, formula, car seats, and mater-
nity clothing; 
Whereas crisis pregnancy centers create a confidential, wel-
coming, and compassionate environment for those in need 
of support; 
Whereas crisis pregnancy centers do not discriminate based 
on age, race, religious affiliation, nationality, or dis-
ability; 
Whereas individuals who choose to receive support at crisis 
pregnancy centers are given the opportunity to explore 
the spiritual dimensions of their choices; 
Whereas studies show that individuals who seek the services 
of crisis pregnancy centers are less likely to receive an 
abortion and more likely to choose to continue their preg-
nancy with the aid and resources provided by crisis preg-
nancy centers; 
Whereas no matter the legal standing of abortion, there will 
always be women and men who find themselves in crisis 
pregnancies; and 
Whereas there will always be a need for safe accessibility to 
crisis pregnancy centers: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
