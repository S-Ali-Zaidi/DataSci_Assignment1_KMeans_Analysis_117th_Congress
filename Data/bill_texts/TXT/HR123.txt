Whereas under the leadership of the Department of Health 
and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Acting De-
fense Secretary Christopher Miller, Chief Advisor Dr. 
Moncef Slaoui, and General Gustave F. Perna, Operation 
Warp Speed accelerated the development of the COVID– 
19 vaccine while maintaining world-class standards of 
safety and efficacy; 
Whereas thanks to the tireless work of the scientific commu-
nity and tens of thousands of dedicated Americans who 
participated in the vaccination trials, on December 11, 
2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued the first 
emergency use authorization for a vaccine for the preven-
tion of COVID–19; 
Whereas just one month after approval, pharmaceutical com-
panies Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna collectively have 
distributed 41,411,550 COVID–19 vaccine doses across 
the United States; 
Whereas due to the outstanding work of these pharmaceutical 
companies and the safe and expedient regulatory approv-
als facilitated by Operation Warp Speed, as of early Feb-
ruary 2021, 32,867,213 Americans have received at least 
one dose of the COVID–19 vaccine; and 
Whereas the development of the COVID–19 vaccine has al-
lowed our Nation to combat the virus, begin the healing 
process, and move closer to a full reopening of our Na-
tion’s economy: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
