issued an emergency temporary standard (ETS) to re-
quire employers with more than 100 employees to ensure

COVID–19 or subject them to weekly testing and mask- 
wearing; 
Whereas non-complying businesses could be fined, and non-

•HRES 779 IH 
Whereas Congress tasked the Department of Health and 
Human Services with determining the safety, efficacy, 
and appropriate use of vaccines; 
Whereas Congress authorized the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration to determine whether vaccines should be allowed 
in interstate commerce; 
Whereas Congress empowered the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention to recommend who should receive 
such vaccines; 
Whereas Congress authorized the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration to set and enforce standards af-
fecting the working conditions for workers resulting from 
workplace specific risks; 
Whereas the Occupational Safety and Health Administra-
tion’s use of the emergency temporary standard is an 
abuse of executive authority because COVID–19 is not a 
workplace specific risk; and 
Whereas other agencies have already been given broad au-
thority by Congress on COVID–19 vaccines and miti-
gating the public health effects of COVID–19: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives stands 
1
in opposition to any adverse punishment for private em-
2
ployers and private employees who choose not to receive 
3
the COVID–19 vaccine.
