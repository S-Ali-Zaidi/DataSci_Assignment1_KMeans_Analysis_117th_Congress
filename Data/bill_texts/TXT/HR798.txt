Whereas nearly 92 percent of women killed by firearms in 
high-income countries were American women; 
Whereas firearms are used in nearly 59 percent of cases 
where women are killed by their intimate partners; 
Whereas an average of 57 women are killed by their intimate 
partners using firearms every month; 
Whereas 59 percent of mass shootings between 2014 and 
2019 were connected to instances of domestic or intimate 
partner violence; 
Whereas only 16 percent of victims in domestic violence-re-
lated mass shootings survive such incidents compared to 
37 percent of victims in nondomestic violence-related 
mass shootings; 
Whereas nearly 1 in 10 United States adults have experi-
enced nonfatal firearm abuse at the hands of an intimate 
partner, such as being threatened directly with a firearm 
or by a partner who possessed or had easy access to a 
firearm, or having a firearm fired or pointed at them; 
Whereas 4,500,000 women in the United States reported 
having been threatened with a firearm by an intimate 
partner; 
Whereas, when an abusive male partner has access to a fire-
arm, a female victim of such abuse is 5 times more likely 
to be killed; 
Whereas, in two-thirds of households with a history of abuse 
and with firearms present, the abusive partner used the 
firearm against the victim by threatening or otherwise 
terrorizing them; 
Whereas over half of all intimate partner homicides are com-
mitted in never-married relationships;

Whereas the deadly intersection of firearms and intimate 
partner violence affects all women, but it has a dispropor-
tionate impact on Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, 
and Hispanic women; 
Whereas 1 in 3 Hispanic women have experienced intimate 
partner violence; 
Whereas, compared to non-Hispanic White women, Black 
women are twice as likely to be fatally shot by an inti-
mate partner, and nearly 3 times more likely at the ages 
between 18 and 34; 
Whereas more than half of the population of American In-
dian/Alaska Native women have experienced physical vio-
lence by intimate partners; and 
Whereas early research shows that domestic and intimate 
partner violence have increased during the COVID–19 
pandemic: Now, therefore, be it
