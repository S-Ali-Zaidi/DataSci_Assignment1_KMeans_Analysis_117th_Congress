der once since President Biden appointed her to lead ef-
forts to stem migration across the United States-Mexico 
border; 
Whereas border security is national security and the ongoing 
influx of migrants poses a significant threat to the public 
health and safety of our communities; 
Whereas, under the Biden administration, a historic number 
of illegal immigrants, violent criminals, and deadly drugs 
have flooded into our communities through the southern 
border; 
Whereas over two million migrants illegally crossed our 
southern border in the fiscal year 2021; 
Whereas U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) re-
ported a 1,066 percent increase in fentanyl seized at 
eight southern Texas ports during fiscal year 2021 under 
President Biden; 
Whereas the Biden administration has allowed for mass mi-

its judgment when assessing policies; 
Whereas our southern border is less safe now than it ever has 
been; and 
Whereas U.S. Customs and Border Protection is underfunded 
and lacks resources needed due to Vice President Har-

Resolved, That the House of Representatives urges

the Biden administration to—
