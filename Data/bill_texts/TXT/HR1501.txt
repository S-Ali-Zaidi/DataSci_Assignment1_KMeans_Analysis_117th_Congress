Whereas the average length of time a child spends in foster 
care waiting to be adopted is 33.7 months; 
Whereas, for many unparented children, the wait for a loving 
family in which the children are nurtured, comforted, and 
protected seems endless; 
Whereas, in 2021, 14,380 children were at risk of aging out 
of foster care by reaching adulthood without being placed 
in a permanent home; 
Whereas, every day, loving and nurturing families are 
strengthened and expanded when committed and dedi-
cated individuals make an important difference in the life 
of a child through adoption; 
Whereas, while nearly a quarter of individuals in the United 
States have considered adoption, a majority of individuals 
in the United States have misperceptions about the proc-
ess of adopting children from foster care and the children 
who are eligible for adoption; 
Whereas family reunification, kinship care, and domestic and 
intercountry adoption promote greater permanency and 
stability for children; 
Whereas the Children’s Bureau, an office of the Administra-
tion for Children and Families within the Department of 
Health and Human Services, supports programs, re-
search, and monitoring to help eliminate barriers to 
adoption and find permanent families for children; 
Whereas National Adoption Day is a collective national effort 
to find permanent, loving families for children in the fos-
ter care system; 
Whereas, since the first National Adoption Day in 2000, 
more than 75,000 children have joined permanent fami-
lies on National Adoption Day;

Whereas the President traditionally issues an annual procla-
mation to declare the month of November as National
