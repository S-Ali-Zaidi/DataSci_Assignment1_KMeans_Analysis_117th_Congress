Whereas the United States has relied on Gibraltar’s military 
facilities numerous times, including America’s first over-
seas military intervention in 1801 against the Barbary 
States, World War II, and the North Atlantic Treaty Or-
ganization intervention in 2011 in Libya; 
Whereas, during World War II, General Dwight Eisenhower 
used Gibraltar as his headquarters to plan the liberation 
of North Africa stating, ‘‘Without it the vital air cover 
would not have been quickly established on the North Af-
rican fields.’’; 
Whereas the security situation in North Africa and the Mid-
dle East continues to underscore the need for the United 
States to maintain secure access to Gibraltar’s military 
facilities; 
Whereas Gibraltar has the right, under the United Nations 
Charter and the International Covenant on Civil and Po-
litical Rights, to determine its own future; and 
Whereas the United Kingdom is a loyal ally that has stood 
by the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
