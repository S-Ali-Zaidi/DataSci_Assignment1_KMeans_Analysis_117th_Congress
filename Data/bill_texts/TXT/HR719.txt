Whereas there has been a persistent shortage of nurses 
across all fields, while demand continues to grow; 
Whereas mothers are dying in the United States at the high-
est rate in the developed world, and the crisis is most se-
vere for Black mothers; 
Whereas nurses are positioned to provide unique insight into 
patient care circumstances that may contribute to wom-
en’s deaths, thereby reducing the rate of and disparity in 
maternal mortality; 
Whereas October, the 10th month of the year, was chosen to 
celebrate ‘‘National Perinatal Nurses Week’’ to represent 
an Apgar score of 10; 
Whereas Apgar is the point system used to evaluate the 
health of a newborn baby, with 10 representing the 
healthiest possible score for a baby, and this score is as-
signed and recorded by the perinatal nurse attending the 
birth; 
Whereas the 10th day of the month of October was chosen 
to begin ‘‘National Perinatal Nurses Week’’ to represent 
10 centimeters dilated, the measurement used to evaluate 
a woman’s progress in labor; 
Whereas 10 centimeters dilated constitutes complete cervical 
dilation, the successful completion of the first phase of 
labor when a woman is ready to deliver her baby, and 
this progress is supported and recorded by the perinatal 
nurse attending the birth; and 
Whereas the week of October 10, 2021, through October 16, 
2021, is set aside to celebrate ‘‘National Perinatal 
Nurses Week’’ to raise public awareness of and celebrate 
the 350,000 perinatal nurses who are clinically active in
