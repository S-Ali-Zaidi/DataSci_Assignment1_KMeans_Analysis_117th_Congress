RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
Congress should take all appropriate measures to ensure 
that the United States Postal Service remains an inde-
pendent establishment of the Federal Government and 
is not subject to privatization. 
Whereas the United States Postal Service is a constitu-
tionally mandated service per article I, section 8, clause 
7 of the Constitution; 
Whereas the United States Postal Service is a self-sustaining, 
independent establishment that does not receive taxpayer 
funding and relies solely on revenue derived from the sale 
of postal services and products;

Whereas the United States Postal Service and its more than 
500,000 employees are at the center of the $1.4 trillion 
mailing industry, employing a total of 7.5 million Ameri-
cans; 
Whereas the United States Postal Service serves the needs of 
157 million business and residential customers at least 
six days a week, maintains an affordable and universal 
network, and connects the country’s rural, suburban, and 
urban communities; 
Whereas the United States Postal Service is consistently the 
highest rated agency of the Federal Government in non-
partisan opinion polls; 
Whereas the United States Postal Service is the Nation’s sec-
ond-largest employer of military veterans; 
Whereas postal employees are dedicated public servants who 
do more than process and deliver the Nation’s mail, they 
serve as the eyes and ears of the Nation’s communities 
and often respond first in situations involving health, 
safety, and crime in their communities; 
Whereas privatization of the United States Postal Service 
would result in higher prices and reduced services for its 
customers, especially in rural communities; and 
Whereas privatization of the United States Postal Service 
would jeopardize the booming e-commerce sector and 
cripple a major part of the Nation’s critical infrastruc-
ture: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
