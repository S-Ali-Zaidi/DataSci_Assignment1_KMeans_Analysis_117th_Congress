Mr. GRIJALVA (for himself and Mr. SAN NICOLAS) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Education and Labor 
RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of National Middle Level 
Education Month. 
Whereas the National Association of Secondary School Prin-
cipals, the Association for Middle Level Education, and 
the Alliance for Excellent Education have declared the 
month of March 2021 as National Middle Level Edu-
cation Month; 
Whereas schools that educate middle grades students play a 
critical function in the Nation’s educational system in 
that they are responsible for educating young adolescents 
between the ages of 10 and 15 (grades 5 through 9) that 
are undergoing rapid and dramatic changes in their phys-
ical, intellectual, social, emotional, and moral develop-
ment;

Whereas each day over 19,000,000 young adolescents en-
gaged in school deserving what research and practice 
have shown to help middle grades students achieve, in-
cluding challenging and engaging instruction, teachers 
and administrators who are knowledgeable and prepared 
to provide young adolescents with a safe, challenging, and 
supportive learning environment, and organizational 
structures that banish anonymity and promote personal-
ization, collaboration, and social equity; 
Whereas neuroscience indicates that the majority of middle 
grades students are in a critical stage of brain develop-
ment that promotes productive adulthood; 
Whereas the habits and values established during early ado-
lescence have a critical, lifelong influence that directly 
impacts the future health and welfare of the Nation; 
Whereas research has found that the academic achievement 
of eighth grade students has a larger impact on their 
readiness for college by the end of high school than any-
thing that happens academically in high school; 
Whereas research has found that middle level education is 
underfunded creating a ‘‘missing middle’’ in Federal edu-
cation funding; 
Whereas in order to improve graduation rates and prepare 
students to be lifelong learners ready for college, career, 
and citizenship, a deeper public understanding of the dis-
tinctive mission of the middle level is necessary; and 
Whereas the month of March 2021 has been declared as Na-
tional Middle Level Education Month by numerous edu-
cational groups: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
