saving for retirement or their child’s education, as well 
as everyday Americans’ pension funds and savings be-
cause a financial transactions tax is applied each time a 
transaction is conducted; 
Whereas studies have shown that a typical mutual fund in-
vestor would likely lose multiple years’ worth of savings 
to a 0.1 percent Federal financial transactions tax, and 
could lose decades worth of savings to a 0.5 percent fi-
nancial transactions tax; 
Whereas a Federal financial transactions tax will cause pen-
sion fund expenses to increase and their returns to de-
crease, exacerbating the current problems with under-
funded pensions and making it less attractive for govern-
ments and companies to offer pension plans; 
Whereas a Federal financial transactions tax will harm work-
er wages and destroy American jobs by increasing the 
cost of capital and reducing productivity; 
Whereas a Federal financial transactions tax would reduce li-
quidity in the capital markets; 
Whereas the Congressional Budget Office has found that a 
proposed financial transactions tax would ‘‘immediately 
lower the value of financial assets’’; and 
Whereas not only will a Federal financial transactions tax 
slow economic growth, other countries’ failures at imple-
menting a financial transactions tax demonstrate the tax 
will not raise expected revenue and will lead to an exit 
of trading activity for more favorable jurisdictions: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
