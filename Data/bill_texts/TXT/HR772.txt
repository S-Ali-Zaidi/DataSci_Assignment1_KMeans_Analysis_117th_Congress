Whereas embracing the gig economy offers workers great 
freedom and flexibility in their hours, locations, and occu-
pations; 
Whereas 75 percent of gig workers report their earnings are 
equal or more than with a more traditional work environ-
ment; 
Whereas the gig economy offers businessowners advantages, 
such as the ability to hire experts for services not regu-
larly needed or extra workers for busy seasons and lower 
space costs; 
Whereas gig workers comprise approximately 36 percent of 
United States workers, an 8-percent increase from 2019, 
resulting in roughly 59,000,000 Americans engaging in 
some type of freelance labor; 
Whereas gig workers contributed nearly $1.21 trillion to the 
American economy in 2020; 
Whereas the number of gig workers has grown exponentially 
in recent years, with approximately 30,000,000 Ameri-
cans’ primary income deriving from the gig economy; 
Whereas 67 percent of gig workers reported that their jobs 
prepared them for the uncertainty of the COVID–19 pan-
demic better than those in traditional jobs; 
Whereas according to data from 2020, 50 percent of those 
aged 18 to 22 and 44 percent of those aged 23 to 38 
chose the gig economy over traditional employment; 
Whereas elected officials and communities have taken actions 
to end the gig economy by supporting legislation that 
would require freelance workers to register as traditional 
employees, removing their freedom and flexibility to work 
where, when, and how they want; and

Whereas legislation forcing gig workers to classify as employ-
ees could supersede State laws such as Prop 22 in Cali-
fornia, which overturned worker classification laws and 
strengthened contractor freedom: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes the rising importance of gig 
2
workers, freelance laborers, and other independent 
3
contractors to the American economy; and 
4
(2) recognizes the benefits of gig work to entre-
5
preneurs and individuals seeking flexible hours, loca-
6
tions, and occupations and the benefit of additional 
7
income-earning potential.
