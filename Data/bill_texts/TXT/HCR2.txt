hunger and demonstrated strong personal moral leader-
ship; 
Whereas it was his leadership that guided the Hunger Pre-
vention Act of 1988, which required the Secretary of Ag-
riculture not only to distribute surplus food, but also to 
purchase additional food for future distributions to needy 
households; 
Whereas Mickey Leland brought together entertainment per-
sonalities, religious leaders, and private volunteer agen-
cies to generate public support for the African Famine 
Relief and Recovery Act of 1985, which provided 
$800,000,000 in food and humanitarian relief supplies; 
Whereas the various initiatives brought forth by Mickey Le-
land to eradicate world hunger undoubtedly saved thou-
sands of lives; 
Whereas 2007 marks the 18th anniversary of Mickey Le-
land’s death; 
Whereas Mickey Leland died as he lived: on a mission to 
make a positive difference in this world; and 
Whereas commemorative postage stamps have been commis-
sioned to honor other great leaders in American history: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that—
