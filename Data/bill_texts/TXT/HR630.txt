United States from terror threats by denying entry to certain individuals

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
SEPTEMBER 10, 2021 
Mr. MEUSER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary 
RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of Congress that President Biden must 
secure the United States from terror threats by denying 
entry to certain individuals due to a heightened terror 
threat from an unstable Afghanistan. 
Whereas the Biden administration’s evacuation of United 
States citizens, military personnel, and Afghan allies 
from Afghanistan was ill-executed and required addi-
tional military personnel to be placed in a dangerously 
untenable position to complete an unnecessarily hasty 
withdrawal; 
Whereas the resulting instability in Afghanistan threatens the 
safety of American citizens and the security of the Amer-
ican homeland;

•HRES 630 IH 
Whereas 13 United States soldiers were killed by a terrorist 
attack at Hamid Karzai International Airport on August 
26, 2021; 
Whereas estimates indicate 5,000 to 7,000 prisoners were re-
leased by the Taliban when they captured Bagram Air 
Base, including many al-Qaida operatives; 
Whereas Afghanistan has previously been a hub for terrorist 
activity and training; 
Whereas Pentagon officials have warned that extremist 
groups could regenerate in Afghanistan within two years 
of the United States withdrawing military forces; 
Whereas, in July 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
reported 212,672 encounters on the southwest border, 
the highest recorded level; 
Whereas the Biden administration has rescinded or weakened 
border security policies including the southwest border 
wall, the Migrant Protection Protocols, and title 42 ex-
pulsion; and 
Whereas the President has broad authority under section 
212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to deny 
entry to aliens who pose a threat to the United States 
and the American people: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives calls on 
1
President Biden to use his executive authority under sec-
2
tion 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to se-
3
cure the border and points of entry by denying entry to 
4
individuals from Afghanistan who pose a terrorist threat 
5
to the United States.
