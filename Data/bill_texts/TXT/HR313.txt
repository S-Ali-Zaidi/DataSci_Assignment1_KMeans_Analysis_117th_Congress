tims’ Rights Week, first proclaimed by President Ronald

ored tradition that has honored and validated the impact

them;

geography, racial inequity, sexual orientation, and/or dis-
ability; 
Whereas we can engage communities to support— 
(1) victim and survivor services;

grams; and 
(3) efforts to help communities to prepare for and 
respond to devastating acts of mass violence and domes-
tic terrorism; and

cus and the United States Congress commit to the adop-
tion of policies and programs that identify and meet the
