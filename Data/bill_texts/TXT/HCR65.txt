Whereas fraternal benefit societies represent a successful, 
modern-day model under which individuals come together 
with a common purpose to collectively provide charitable 
and other beneficial activities for society; 
Whereas fraternal benefit societies operate under a chapter 
system, creating a nationwide infrastructure, combined 
with local energy and knowledge, which positions fra-
ternal benefit societies to most efficiently address unmet 
needs in communities, many of which government cannot 
address; 
Whereas the fraternal benefit society model represents one of 
the largest member-volunteer networks in the United 
States, with approximately 8,000,000 people of the 
United States belonging to more than 25,000 local chap-
ters across the country; 
Whereas research has shown that the value of the work of 
fraternal benefit societies to society is more than 
$3,800,000,000 per year, accounting for charitable giv-
ing, educational programs, and volunteer activities, as 
well as important social capital that strengthens the fab-
ric, safety, and quality of life in thousands of local com-
munities in the United States; 
Whereas, in 1909, Congress recognized the value of fraternal 
benefit societies and exempted those organizations from 
taxation, as later codified in section 501(c)(8) of the In-
ternal Revenue Code of 1986; 
Whereas fraternals have adapted since 1909 to better serve 
the evolving needs of their members and the public; 
Whereas the efforts of fraternal benefit societies to help peo-
ple of the United States save money and be financially

secure relieves pressures on government safety net pro-
grams; and 
Whereas Congress recognizes that fraternal benefit societies 
have served their original purpose for more than a cen-
tury, helping countless individuals, families, and commu-
nities through their fraternal member activities: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that—

(1) the fraternal benefit society model is a suc-

cessful private sector economic and social support

go unmet;
