States to defend the people of the Philippines even after

gression in the Asia Pacific region, President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt issued a military order calling the organized 
military forces of the Government of the Commonwealth 
of the Philippines into service under the command of 
General Douglas MacArthur; 
Whereas President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s military order 
stated, ‘‘As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy 
of the United States, I hereby call and order into service 
of the Armed Forces of the United States for the period 
of the existing emergency, and place under the command 
of a General Officer, United States Army, to be des-
ignated by the Secretary of War from time to time, all 
of the organized military forces of the Government of the 
Commonwealth of the Philippines’’; 
Whereas, on December 7, 1941, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and 
Clark Air Field in the Philippines were suddenly at-
tacked, initiating fighting on the Pacific front during 
World War II, which led to the loss of hundreds of thou-
sands of American and Filipino soldiers and countless ci-
vilian casualties; 
Whereas, on February 20, 1946, President Harry Truman 
stated, ‘‘Philippine Army veterans are nationals of the 
United States and will continue in that status until July 
4, 1946. They fought, as American nationals, under the 
American flag, and under the direction of our military 
leaders. They fought with gallantry and courage under 
most difficult conditions.’’;

Whereas, on October 17, 1996, President William J. Clinton 
issued a proclamation on the anniversary of the 1944 re-
turn of United States forces under General MacArthur to 
liberate the Philippines and said, ‘‘I urge all Americans 
to recall the courage, sacrifice, and loyalty of Filipino 
Veterans of World War II and honor them for their con-
tribution to our freedom.’’; 
Whereas, on July 26, 2001, President George W. Bush, in 
his greetings to the Filipino World War II veterans said, 
‘‘More than 120,000 Filipinos fought with unwavering 
loyalty and great gallantry under the command of Gen-
eral Douglas MacArthur. The combined United States- 
Philippine forces distinguished themselves by their valor 
and heroism in defense of freedom and democracy. Thou-
sands of Filipino soldiers gave their lives in the battles 
of Bataan and Corregidor. These soldiers won for the 
United States the precious time needed to disrupt the en-
emy’s plan for conquest in the Pacific. During the 3 long 
years following these battles, the Filipino people valiantly 
resisted a brutal Japanese occupation with an indomi-
table spirit and steadfast loyalty to America.’’; 
Whereas originally more than 250,000 Filipinos served this 
cause;
