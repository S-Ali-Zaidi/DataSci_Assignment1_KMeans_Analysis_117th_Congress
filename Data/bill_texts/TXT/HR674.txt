RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of September 22, 
2021, as ‘‘National Hispanic Nurses Day’’. 
Whereas a special group of nurses in the Nation are the His-
panic nurses; 
Whereas Hispanic nurses provide culturally and ethnically 
competent care and are educated to be sensitive to re-
gional and community customs of persons needing care;

LPNs) in the United States and is the only nursing orga-
nization for Hispanic nurses whose mission is to advance 
the health in Hispanic communities and to lead, promote, 
and advocate for educational, professional, and leadership 
opportunities for Hispanic nurses; 
Whereas, since September is the month that has been set 
aside to honor the contributions of Hispanics, it is only 
fitting that Hispanic nurses be recognized and honored 
during this time for their outstanding contributions to 
their community and country; 
Whereas the designation of an observation day will help to 
raise awareness of the accomplishments of Hispanic 
nurses and pave the way for the important work that 
they must continue to carry out; 
Whereas, each February, NAHN convenes nearly 100 nurs-
ing leaders from academia, research, education, and prac-
tice in Washington, DC, for a Day on Capitol Hill pro-
moting legislation that improves the health of Hispanic 
communities; 
Whereas Hispanic nurses are strong allies to Congress as 
they help inform, educate, and work closely with legisla-
tors to improve the education, retention, recruitment, and 
practice of all nurses and, more importantly, the health 
and safety of the patients they care for; and 
Whereas Hispanic nurses add needed diversity to the profes-
sion, and these nurses have engaged in numerous ways 
to support community and needs of an overlooked, under 
resourced, and underserved population being severely im-
pacted by COVID–19: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
