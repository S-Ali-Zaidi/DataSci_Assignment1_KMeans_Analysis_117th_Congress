Whereas it remains a standing policy of the United States to 
support Israel’s security efforts; 
Whereas American policy has long sought to bring peace to 
the Middle East and recognize that both the Israeli and

ereign states, free from fear and violence, with mutual 
recognition; and

Jewish people of Israel: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) condemns the acts of terrorism committed

6
tion and collective security against external forces;
