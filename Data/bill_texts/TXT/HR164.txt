RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of National Engineers Week. 
Whereas engineers employ their scientific knowledge and ana-
lytical skills for the betterment of the United States and 
for the protection of the public health, safety, and wel-
fare; 
Whereas the mission of the National Engineers Week Foun-
dation (doing business as DiscoverE) is to sustain and 
grow a dynamic engineering profession through outreach, 
education, celebration, and volunteerism as needed to

keep the United States a global leader in engineering and 
engineering education; 
Whereas the sponsors of National Engineers Week are work-
ing together to transform the engineering workforce 
through greater inclusion of women and underrepresented 
minorities; 
Whereas by engaging young students, parents, and educators 
in hands-on science, technology, engineering, and mathe-
matics (STEM) activities, engineers help them discover 
how they can make a meaningful difference in the world; 
Whereas the partnership between engineers and teachers in-
spires future generations of engineering and technology 
talent; 
Whereas tens of thousands of engineers and engineering stu-
dents will serve their communities not only through their 
work but, at this time of year, by reaching into hundreds 
of local communities; 
Whereas the perspective and technical expertise of engineers 
is vital to solving today’s most pressing global chal-
lenges—including infrastructure, national security, and 
environmental sustainability—and the professional engi-
neer’s commitment to high ethical standards is necessary 
for the protection of public health, safety, and welfare; 
Whereas ‘‘science creates more opportunity for the next gen-
eration’’, according to the National Science Board’s 2018 
Science and Engineering Indicators; 
Whereas engineers are a crucial link in research, develop-
ment, and the transformation of scientific discoveries into 
useful products and jobs, as the people of the United 
States look more than ever to engineers and their imagi-

nation, knowledge, and analytical skills to meet the chal-
lenges of the future; 
Whereas the National Science Board’s 2018 Science and En-
gineering Indicators show that the number of students 
obtaining engineering bachelor’s degrees in the United 
States has increased steadily for the last 15 years for 
which data are available, yet the rates for women do not 
reflect our national demographics, with only 20 percent 
of bachelor’s degrees in engineering being earned by 
women; 
Whereas the National Science Board’s ‘‘Science and Engi-
neering Indicators 2020’’ shows that historically under-
represented racial and ethnic groups, particularly Blacks 
and Hispanics, ‘‘remain underrepresented in the [science 
& engineering (S&E)] workforce relative to their overall 
presence in the workforce and the population’’; 
Whereas the National Science Foundation’s National Center 
for Science and Engineering Statistics report on 
‘‘Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in 
Science and Engineering 2017’’ shows that women are 
closing the gap with men in S&E educational attainment 
but are still underrepresented in S&E occupations; 
Whereas only around 4 percent of the Nation’s workforce is 
comprised of scientists and engineers, yet this group dis-
proportionately creates jobs for the other 96 percent; 
Whereas DiscoverE has grown into a formal coalition of more 
than 100 professional societies, major corporations, and 
government agencies that serves as a hub of engineering 
outreach dedicated to ensuring a diverse and well-edu-
cated engineering workforce, promoting literacy in 
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and

raising public awareness and appreciation of the con-
tributions of engineers to society; 
Whereas Congress has recognized National Engineers Week 
every year since 1951; and 
Whereas February 21, 2021, to February 27, 2021, has been 
designated as National Engineers Week by DiscoverE 
and the theme is ‘‘Imagining Tomorrow’’, spotlighting 
the important contributions of the engineering commu-
nity to our quality of life both now and in the future, in-
cluding creating a world safe from pandemics, climate 
change, and other global challenges; creating awe-inspir-
ing wonders like cloud-busting skyscrapers and human 
travel to Mars; and daily marvels like clean drinking 
water, computers, and cars: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of National 
2
Engineers Week to increase understanding of and 
3
interest in engineering and technology careers and to 
4
promote technological literacy and engineering edu-
5
cation; 
6
(2) recognizes that engineering education is a 
7
critical component of STEM (science, technology, 
8
engineering, and mathematics) education and essen-
9
tial to improving the United States educational sys-
10
tem and economic prosperity; and

(3) ensures that technological solutions de-

signed by the engineering community can be ad-
