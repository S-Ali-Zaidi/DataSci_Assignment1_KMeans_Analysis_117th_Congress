was referred to the Committee on Natural Resources 
RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives to 
recognize the crisis of violence against Native women. 
Whereas according to a study commissioned by the Depart-
ment of Justice, in some Tribal communities American 
Indian women face murder rates that are more than 10 
times the national average; 
Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, homicide was the third leading cause of death 
among American Indian and Alaska Native women be-
tween 10 and 24 years of age and the sixth leading cause 
of death for American Indian and Alaska Native women

of missing American Indian and Alaska Native women in 
the United States; 
Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.5 times 
more likely to experience violent crimes and at least 2 
times more likely to experience rape or sexual assault 
crimes than people who are not American Indians or 
Alaska Natives; 
Whereas 97 percent of female and 90 percent of male Amer-
ican Indian and Alaska Native victims report being vic-
timized by a non-Indian; 
Whereas according to a 2010 Government Accountability Of-
fice report, the Offices of the United States Attorneys de-
clined to prosecute nearly 52 percent of violent crimes 
that occur in Indian country; 
Whereas the Indian Law and Order Commission issued a re-
port entitled ‘‘A Roadmap for Making Native America 
Safer’’, that recommends the restoration of the inherent 
authority of Tribal courts; and 
Whereas Tribal communities should be able to protect them-
selves from domestic violence, sexual assault, dating vio-
lence, stalking, sex trafficking, violence against children, 
violence against elders, and from violence committed 
against members of the Tribal justice system: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

resentatives to recognize the crisis of violence against Na-

tive women.
