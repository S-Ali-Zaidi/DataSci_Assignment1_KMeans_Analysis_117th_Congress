America, 
affecting 
nearly 
7,000,000 individuals in nonmetropolitan areas; 
Whereas the National Center for Health Statistics reported 
the 2017 suicide rate for the most rural counties was 1.8 
times higher than the suicide rate for the most urban 
counties; 
Whereas there is a chronic shortage of mental health profes-
sionals in rural areas;

services and are frequently seen by providers who are less 
likely to recognize a mental illness; 
Whereas rural residents suffering from mental illness may be 
more susceptible to negative public attitudes in small 
communities; 
Whereas data from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for

and Human Services show that uninsured rates in rural 
areas have been 2 to 3 percentage points higher than in 
urban areas over the 2010 to 2019 period; and
