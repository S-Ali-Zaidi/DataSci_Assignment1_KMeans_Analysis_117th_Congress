H. RES. 1391 
Expressing support of the designation of September 2022 as Peripheral Artery 
Disease Awareness Month. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
SEPTEMBER 22, 2022 
Mr. PAYNE (for himself, Mr. BILIRAKIS, Ms. NORTON, Mr. LAWSON of Flor-
ida, and Ms. UNDERWOOD) submitted the following resolution; which was 
referred to the Committee on Oversight and Reform 
RESOLUTION 
Expressing support of the designation of September 2022 
as Peripheral Artery Disease Awareness Month. 
Whereas peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects nearly 
20,000,000 Americans, including an estimated 200,000 
Americans who are from disproportionately minority com-
munities; 
Whereas PAD is a chronic condition that causes narrowing 
or blockage of blood vessels that carry blood from the 
heart to the legs; 
Whereas the primary cause of PAD is the buildup of plaque 
in the arteries or atherosclerosis; 
Whereas many risk factors for PAD include smoking, high 
blood pressure, atherosclerosis, diabetes, high cholesterol, 
and being 60 years of age or older;

•HRES 1391 IH 
Whereas individuals with type 2 diabetes and PAD are four 
times more likely to lose a limb compared to individuals 
without either such disease; 
Whereas individuals who smoke are three times more likely 
to develop PAD; 
Whereas researchers analyzing data from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999–2004) 
found that 5.9 percent of the United States population 
aged 40 years or older have a low ankle brachial index 
(ABI) (≤0.9), which indicates the presence of PAD; 
Whereas African Americans are twice as likely to be diag-
nosed with PAD and up to three times as likely to have 
an amputation; 
Whereas if not properly diagnosed, PAD can lead to nontrau-
matic lower limb amputations; 
Whereas unnecessary amputations drastically reduce the 
quality of life for PAD patients; and 
Whereas educating people on the risks of PAD and encour-
aging early screenings are crucial to preventing unneces-
sary amputations: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Peripheral 
2
Artery Disease Awareness Month; and 
3
(2) encourages the people of the United States 
4
to observe the month with appropriate awareness 
5
and educational activities.
