Whereas the Biden administration’s conduct of the with-
drawal from Afghanistan has led to international con-
demnation of the United States, including from our al-
lies; 
Whereas the Biden administration’s conduct of the with-
drawal has diminished the United States standing on the 
international stage, allowing adversaries such as Russia 
and China to call into question the United States ability 
to fulfill its military and defense commitments; 
Whereas the Biden administration allowed billions of tax-
payer dollars in military equipment to fall into the hands 
of the Taliban, including small arms, body armor, land 
vehicles, helicopters, and drones; 
Whereas the Biden administration has jeopardized the safety 
of United States citizens and Afghan allies stranded in 
Afghanistan by willingly sharing their identities with 
Taliban officials; 
Whereas the actions laid out above constitute a severe derelic-
tion of duty and a failure to fulfill the oaths of office 
taken by Secretary of Defense Lloyd James Austin III; 
and 
Whereas these failures have created a permanent rupture of 
trust between this military chain of command and the 
American people and our allies: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that Secretary of Defense Lloyd James Aus-
2
tin III immediately resign from office.
