the United Nations should forthwith take the procedural 
actions necessary to amend Article 23 of the Charter

and security with the least diversion for armaments of 
the world’s human and economic resources; 
Whereas the preamble of the Charter of the United Nations 
states that ‘‘we the peoples of the United Nations deter-
mined to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in 
the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal 
rights of men and women and of nations large and 
small’’ and ‘‘to practice tolerance and live together in 
peace with one another as good neighbors’’; 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China has grossly violated 
these values in their treatment of minorities within the 
People’s Republic of China, such as the Uyghur people 
and Tibetans; 
Whereas Hong Kong was a beacon of democracy, economic 
progress, and human development while maintaining sep-
arate governing and economic systems from that of main-
land China under the principle of ‘‘one country, two sys-
tems’’; 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China’s continued interven-
tion in Hong Kong, including the controversial national 
security laws for Hong Kong passed by the National Peo-
ple’s Congress on May 28, 2020, further threatens the 
fundamental human rights and freedoms guaranteed to 
the people of Hong Kong; and 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China lack of transparency 
and handling of the COVID–19 pandemic resulted in sig-
nificantly greater lives lost and worldwide economic ruin: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

resentatives that the United Nations should forthwith take

the procedural actions necessary to amend Article 23 of
