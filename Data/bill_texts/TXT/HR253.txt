Whereas, on April 8, 1971, the First World Romani Congress 
met in London, bringing Roma together from across Eu-
rope and the United States with the goal of promoting 
transnational cooperation among Roma in combating so-
cial marginalization and building a positive future for 
Roma everywhere; 
Whereas April 8 is therefore celebrated globally as Inter-
national Roma Day; 
Whereas Roma were victims of genocide carried out by Nazi 
Germany and its Axis partners, and an estimated 
200,000 to 500,000 Romani people were killed by Nazis 
and their allies across Europe during World War II; 
Whereas, on the night of August 2–3, 1944, the so-called 
‘‘Gypsy Family Camp’’ where Romani people were in-
terned at Auschwitz-Birkenau was liquidated, and in a 
single night, between 4,200 and 4,300 Romani men, 
women, and children were killed in gas chambers; 
Whereas many countries are taking positive steps to remem-
ber and teach about the genocide of Roma by Nazi Ger-
many and its Axis partners; and 
Whereas the United States Congress held its first hearing to 
examine the situation of Roma in 1994: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) remembers the genocide of Roma by Nazi 
2
Germany and its Axis partners and commemorates 
3
the destruction of the ‘‘Gypsy Family Camp’’ where 
4
Romani people were interned at Auschwitz;
