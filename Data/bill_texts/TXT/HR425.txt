Whereas symptoms are often mistaken for common illnesses 
but can affect the nervous system, the heart, and joints, 
leading to arthritic symptoms, paralysis, encephalitis, sei-
zures, and death if left untreated; 
Whereas a comprehensive approach utilizing increased edu-
cation and more research on Lyme and other tick-borne 
diseases and conditions and their vectors can lead to sig-
nificant advancements; 
Whereas individuals and families should seek out and be 
aware of best practices for the prevention of tick bites 
and Lyme and other tick-borne diseases and conditions; 
Whereas individuals living in or visiting wooded and other 
vulnerable areas should check themselves and their loved 
ones for ticks each day; 
Whereas spring marks the beginning of increased tick-bite ac-
tivity; and 
Whereas May would be an appropriate month to designate as 
‘‘National Lyme and Tick-Borne Disease and Conditions 
Awareness Month’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports 
1
the designation of ‘‘National Lyme and Tick-Borne Dis-
2
