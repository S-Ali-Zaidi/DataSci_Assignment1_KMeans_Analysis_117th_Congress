H. RES. 1178 
Expressing support for the designation of the week of June 27 through 
July 3, 2022, as ‘‘National Tire Safety Week’’ in the United States, 
and supporting the goals and ideals of National Tire Safety Week to

and maintenance. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
JUNE 15, 2022 
Mr. COOPER (for himself, Mr. HUDSON, and Mr. RYAN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure 
RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of the week of June 
27 through July 3, 2022, as ‘‘National Tire Safety 
Week’’ in the United States, and supporting the goals 
and ideals of National Tire Safety Week to educate 
American motorists about the importance of proper tire 
care and maintenance. 
Whereas the first ‘‘National Tire Safety Week’’ was recog-
nized on May 14, 1938, by the Rubber Manufacturers 
Association, now known as the U.S. Tire Manufacturers 
Association; 
Whereas National Tire Safety Week was launched to raise 
awareness about the need for increased education on tire

safety to further reduce tire-related injuries and fatalities 
on the road; 
Whereas tires are highly engineered safety devices that are 
the only parts of a vehicle that have contact with the 
road; 
Whereas tires are required to meet some of the strictest Fed-
eral safety standards set by the National Highway Traf-
fic Safety Administration; 
Whereas data from the Federal Highway Administration indi-
cate that motorists in the United States traveled more 
than 3,200,000,000,000 miles on tires in 2021; 
Whereas maintaining proper tire pressure, periodically rotat-
ing and balancing tires according to the vehicle manufac-
turer’s recommendations (typically every 5,000 to 7,500 
miles), and regularly inspecting tires can help prevent ir-
regular and premature tire wear; 
Whereas excessively worn tires are more susceptible to punc-
tures and hydroplaning in wet conditions; 
Whereas proper tread depth helps tires maintain traction and 
improves handling; 
Whereas tire-tread depth may be checked using a tread depth 
gauge or simply by inserting an upside-down penny into 
the tread to verify it covers at least a portion of Presi-
dent Lincoln’s head; 
Whereas underinflation is 1 of the primary causes of tire dis-
ablement and tire failure, and underinflated tires can 
make controlling a car more difficult, reduce gas mileage, 
lead to excessive heat buildup and stress, and cause ir-
regular wear and internal damage;

Whereas overinflated tires are more likely to be cut, punc-
tured, or damaged when hitting an obstacle, such as a 
pothole; 
Whereas the U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association rec-
ommends drivers regularly check their tire-tread depth, 
ensure that tires are rotated and properly aligned, and 
check their tire pressure monthly using a tire gauge while 
the tires are cold, meaning the car has not been driven 
for 3 hours; 
Whereas a vehicle’s proper tire pressure is affixed to the vehi-
cle’s door jamb next to the driver’s seat and contained 
in the vehicle owner’s manual; 
Whereas motorists should visually scan their tires for cuts, 
cracks, splits, punctures, and bulges, and visit a tire pro-
fessional to assist with any of these conditions; 
Whereas spending just a few minutes each month to inspect 
and maintain a vehicle’s tires can make all the difference 
in the tires’ safety, life, and performance; and 
Whereas this important observance should lead to greater 
safety awareness and a reduction in tire-related road inci-
dents: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
