referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
RESOLUTION 
Urging the United States Secretary of State to take action 
regarding unpaid Peruvian agrarian reform bonds. 
Whereas, beginning in 1969, Peruvian General Juan Velasco 
Alvarado and his military government expropriated mil-
lions of acres of agricultural land as part of a broad 
agrarian reform, and compensated thousands of land-
holders with agrarian reform bonds; 
Whereas, in the 1980s and 1990s, Peru experienced severe 
hyperinflation and twice changed its currency, leaving the 
agrarian reform bonds worthless;

•HRES 289 IH 
Whereas, during the 1980s, Peru defaulted on the agrarian 
reform bonds, and by 1992, Peru’s Government had 
ceased making payments on the agrarian reform bonds; 
Whereas Peru’s Constitutional Tribunal has repeatedly ruled 
that the agrarian reform bonds should be fully reim-
bursed by the Peruvian Government; 
Whereas despite this court ruling, Peru has begun a process 
of payment to bondholders based on a valuation that is 
not consistent with the current value set by Peru’s Con-
stitutional Tribunal in 2001; 
Whereas Peru values the agrarian reform bonds at only tens 
of millions of dollars, even though most outside estimates 
of the current value of the bonds range from between $1 
billion and $10 billion; 
Whereas, since the 1990s, Peru has become one of Latin 
America’s fastest growing economies, with free-trade 
agreements with China and countries in Europe; 
Whereas Peruvian agrarian reform bonds are beneficially 
owned by institutional investors that include not fewer 
than 200 American State, municipal, union, and other 
pension funds located in at least 25 States; and 
Whereas the failure of the Peruvian Government to repay the 
agrarian reform bonds at their current value affects the 
retirement of over 5,000,000 United States pensioners: 
Now, therefore be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives urges 
1
the Secretary of State to take action concerning unpaid 
2
Peruvian agrarian reform bonds to ensure the retirement 
3
security of over 5,000,000 United States pensioners across 
4
the Nation, by encouraging the Peruvian Government to
