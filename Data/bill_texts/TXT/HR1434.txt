nose, prevent, manage, or treat indications or conditions 
that occur during or are related to pregnancy, or other-
wise relate to or affect the reproductive system; 
Whereas reproductive rights and bodily autonomy face a re-
newed, relentless assault by State governments and re-
cent decisions by the Supreme Court; 
Whereas antiabortion State governments have increased their 
efforts to limit, if not outright ban, reproductive health 
products; 
Whereas, under the Supremacy Clause of the United States 
Constitution, Federal laws take precedence over any con-
flicting State laws; 
Whereas Congress delegated to the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration sole authority to approve, license, grant author-
ization for, or clear reproductive health products and 
evaluate the safety and effectiveness of such products in
