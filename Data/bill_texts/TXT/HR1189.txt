Whereas Wi-Fi connectivity is the critical component of tele-
communications 
infrastructure, 
enabling 
households, 
businesses, and institutions to stay connected; 
Whereas the growth in Wi-Fi-enabled devices is unprece-
dented, with some analysts reporting that United States 
households have as many as 25 connected devices, and 
that the trend is continuing; 
Whereas the Wi-Fi Alliance has estimated that by 2025, the 
economic value of Wi-Fi to the United States economy 
will be $1,400,000,000,000, and $4,900,000,000,000 
globally; 
Whereas congressional efforts to identify bipartisan solutions 
to promote broadband access for the American people will 
further expand the role of Wi-Fi in communities in the 
United States; 
Whereas Wi-Fi is essential in underserved areas, where resi-
dential broadband access may not be available, and Wi- 
Fi provides connectivity in public places such as schools, 
libraries, community centers, and other venues; 
Whereas Wi-Fi expands opportunities for Americans to fully 
participate in society by enabling remote work, education, 
civil engagement, health care, and many other valued 
services; 
Whereas, while rural Americans have made large gains in 
adopting digital technology over the past decade and have 
narrowed some digital gaps, rural Americans remain less 
likely than suburban Americans to have home broadband 
and less likely than urban Americans to own a 
smartphone, tablet computer, or traditional computer; 
Whereas urban areas also struggle with connectivity;

Whereas lower-income Americans are more ‘‘smartphone de-
pendent’’, with about 15 percent of American adults 
being ‘‘smartphone-only’’ internet users, meaning that 
they have a smartphone but do not have a home 
broadband connection, and children in these households 
have less ability to use the internet to complete home-
work; 
Whereas, as COVID–19 disrupted the lives of so many Amer-
icans, Wi-Fi played a critical role in keeping Americans 
connected; 
Whereas the demand for Wi-Fi connectivity increased dra-
matically as Americans relied on Wi-Fi for work, edu-
cation, and social interactions during the pandemic 
lockdown; and 
Whereas 9 in 10 Americans say that internet access has been 
essential or important during the pandemic: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) supports the goals and ideals of ‘‘World Wi- 
2
Fi Day’’ to recognize and celebrate the significant

role that Wi-Fi plays in cities and communities

7
Fi in enabling Americans to stay connected; and
