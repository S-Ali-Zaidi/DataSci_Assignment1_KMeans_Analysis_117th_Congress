Whereas, on November 11, our Nation observes Veterans 
Day, a Federal holiday commemorating the men and 
women who served and sacrificed for their country; 
Whereas the service and sacrifice of all American veterans 
must be recognized; 
Whereas the service of approximately 30,000 current resi-

resentation in the House of Representatives and the Sen-
ate, as well as full local self-government; 
Whereas the Washington, D.C. Admission Act (H.R. 51 and 
S. 51) would grant full and equal voting rights in Con-
gress as well as unimpeded democratic control over local

State; and 
Whereas H.R. 51 was passed by the House of Representa-
tives on April 22, 2021: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
1
nizes the service of all District of Columbia veterans, con-

demns the denial of voting representation in Congress and

full local self-government for veterans and their families
