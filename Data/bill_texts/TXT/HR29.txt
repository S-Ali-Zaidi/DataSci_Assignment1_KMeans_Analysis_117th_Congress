Whereas there is a broad consensus among climate scientists 
that the human activities contributing to increases in 
greenhouse gas emissions are the dominant cause of cli-
mate change; 
Whereas, to meaningfully act upon our changing climate and 
changed world, young people need education about its 
causes, consequences, anticipated future impacts, and 
possible solutions; 
Whereas climate change is a social justice, racial justice, and 
human rights issue; 
Whereas, according to the National Center for Science Edu-
cation, 37 States and the District of Columbia recognize 
human-caused climate change in their science education 
standards; 
Whereas the National Science Teaching Association, the Na-
tional Association of Geoscience Teachers, the National 
Association of Biology Teachers, and other professional 
organizations have called for greater support for science 
educators in teaching climate science and climate change; 
Whereas, in 2015, the California State PTA declared climate 
change a children’s issue; 
Whereas, in 2019, the California Association of School Psy-

Whereas children represent a particularly vulnerable group

ability initiatives to educate students and reduce their 
carbon footprint;

understand the human impact of climate change; 
Whereas teaching climate change in schools will help students 
understand that life on Earth depends on, is shaped by, 
and affects our climate;
