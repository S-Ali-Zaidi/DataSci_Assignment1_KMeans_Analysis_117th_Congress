Expressing support for the designation of September 17, 2021, as ‘‘National 
Concussion Awareness Day’’. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
SEPTEMBER 17, 2021 
Mr. PASCRELL (for himself and Mr. BACON) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce 
RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of September 17, 
2021, as ‘‘National Concussion Awareness Day’’. 
Whereas mild traumatic brain injury, otherwise known as a 
‘‘concussion’’, is an important health concern for chil-
dren, teens, and adults; 
Whereas, according to information from the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention— 
(1) there are as many as 1,600,000 to 3,800,000 
sports-related concussions annually; 
(2) as many as 5,300,000 individuals live with a dis-
ability because of a traumatic brain injury; 
(3) between 2010 and 2016, an estimated 2,000,000 
children under age 18 visited an emergency department 
because of a traumatic brain injury sustained during 
sports- or recreation-related activities;

(4) an estimated 283,000 children seek care in 
United States emergency departments each year for a 
sports- or recreation-related traumatic brain injury, with 
traumatic brain injuries sustained in contact sports ac-
counting for approximately 45 percent of these visits; and 
(5) research suggests that many children with a 
traumatic brain injury do not seek care in emergency de-
partments or do not seek care at all, resulting in a sig-
nificant underestimate of prevalence; 
Whereas the seriousness of concussions should not be mini-
mized in athletics, and return-to-play and return-to-learn 
protocols can help ensure recovery; 
Whereas concussions can affect physical, mental, and social 
health, and a greater awareness and understanding of 
proper diagnosis and management of concussions is crit-
ical to improved outcomes; and 
Whereas the House of Representatives can raise awareness 
about concussions among the medical community and the 
public: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) expresses support for the designation of 
2
‘‘National Concussion Awareness Day’’; 
3
(2) recognizes that mild traumatic brain injury 
4
(‘‘mTBI’’), otherwise known as a concussion, is an 
5
important health concern; 
6
(3) commends the organizations and individuals 
7
that raise awareness about mild traumatic brain in-
